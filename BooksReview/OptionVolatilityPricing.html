Two <b>types</b>:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Call option: the right to buy or take a long position in a given
asset at a fixed price on or before a specified data.
</li>
<li>Put option: the right to sell or take a short position in a given
asset.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
The <b>difference</b> between an option and a futures contract:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>A futures contract requires delivery at a fixed price. The seller
must make delivery and the buyer must take delivery of the asset.
</li>
<li>The buyer of an option can choose to take delivery(a call) or make
delivery(a put).
</li>
</ol>


<p>
The <b>exercise price</b>, or <b>strike price</b> is the price at which the
underlying will be delivered should the holder of an option choose to
exercise his right to buy or sell.
</p>

<p>
<b>expiration date</b>: The date after which the option may no longer be
exercised is the expiration date.
</p>

<p>
The premium paid for an option can be separated into two components,
the <b>intrinsic value</b> and the <b>time value</b>.
</p>

<p>
The additional amount ofpremium beyond the intrinsic value which
traders are willing to pay for an option is the time value, sometimes
also referred to as the option's time premium or extrinsic value.  
</p>

<p>
An option's premium is always composed of precisely its intrinsic
value and its time value. If a $400 gold call is trading at $50 with gold
at $435 per ounce, the time value of the call must be $15 , since the
intrinsic value is $35. The two components must add up to the option's
total premium of $50. 
</p>

<p>
If the option has no time value,its price will consist solely of
intrinsic value. The option is trading at <b>parity</b>.
</p>

<p>
Any option which has a positive intrinsic value is said to be
<b>in-the-money</b> by the amount of the intrinsic value. An option which
has no intrinsic value is said to be <b>out-of-the-money</b>.
</p>

<p>
An option whose exercise price is identical to the current price of
the underlying contract is said to be <b>at-the-money</b>, such an option
is also out-of-the-money since it has no intrinsic value.
</p>

<p>
The distinction between an at-the-money and out-of-the-money option 
because an at-the-money option has the greatest amount of time premium
and is usually traded very actively.

direction, he must also be right about <b>market speed</b>.

<li>The price of the underlying contract.
</li>
<li>The exercise price.
</li>
<li>The amount of time remaining to expiration.

<h3 id="sec-3-1">THEORETICAL VALUE</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-1">
<p>
The two most common considerations in a financial investment are the
expected return and carrying costs. And, in fact, dividends are an
additional consideration in evaluating options on stock.
</p>

<p>
The goal of option evaluation is to determine, through the use of
theoretical pricing models, the theoretical value of an option. The
trader can then make an intelligent decision whether the option is
overpriced or underpriced in the marketplace, and whether the
theoretical edage is sufficient to justify going into the marketplace
and making a trade.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-3-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3-2">A SIMPLE APPROACH</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-2">
<p>
We can now summarize the necessary steps in developing a model: 
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Propose a series of possible prices at expiration for the
underlying contract.
</li>
<li>Assign an appropriate probability to each possible price.
</li>
<li>Maintain an arbitrage-free underlying market.
</li>
<li>From the prices and probabi1ities in steps 1, 2, and 3, calculate
the expected  return for the option.
</li>
<li>From the option's expected return, deduct the carrying cost.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
In its original form, the Black-Scholes Model was intended to evaluate
European options (no early exercise permitted) on non-dividend paying
stocks. Shortly after its introduction, realizing that rnost stocks do
pay dividends, Black and Scholes added a dividend cornponent. In 1976,
Fischer Black rnade slight rnodifications to the rnodel to allow for
the evaluation of options on futures contracts. And in 1983, Mark
Garman and Steven Kohlhagen made several other modifications to allow
for the evaluation of options on foreign currencies. The futures
version and the foreign currencyversion are known officially as the
Black Model and the Garman-Kohlhagen Model, respectively. But the
evaluation rnethod in each version, whether the original Black-Scholes
Model for stock options, the Black Model for futures options, or the
Garman-Kohlhagen Model for foreign currency options, is so similar
that they have all come to be known as simply the Black-Scholes Model.
The various forrns of the model differ primarily in how they calculate
the forward price of由eunderlying contract, and an option trader will
simply choose the form appropriate to the underlying instrument.
</p>

<p>
In order to calculate an option's theoretical value using the
Black-Scholes Model, we need to know at a minimum five characteristics
of the option and its underlying contract. There are:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The option's exercise price.
</li>
<li>The amount of time remaining to expiration.
</li>
<li>The current price of the underlying contract.
</li>
<li>The risk-free interest rate over the life of the option.
</li>
<li>The volatility of the underlying contract.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Black and Scholes also incorporated into their model the concept of
the <b>riskless hedge</b>. To take advantage of a theoretically mispriced
option，it is necessary to establish a hedge by offsetting the option
position with this theoretically equivalent underlying position. That
is, whatever option position we take, we must take an opposing market
position in the underlying contract. The correct proportion of
underlying contracts needed to establish this riskless hedge is known
as the <b>hedge ratlo</b>.
</p>
</div>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
</div><div id="outline-container-sec-4-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-4-1">RANDOM WALKS AND NORMAL DISTRIBUTIONS</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-1">
<p>
Thís leads to an important distínction between evaluation of an
underlying contract and evaluation of an option. If we assume at
prices are distributed along a normal distribution curve, the value of
an underlying contract depends on where the peak of the curve is
located, while the value of an option depends on how fast le curve
spreads out.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-4-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-4-2">LOGNORMAL DISTRIBUTIONS</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-2">
<p>
A continuously compounded rate of return of +12% yields a profit of
$127.50 after one year,while a continuously compounded rate of return
of -12% yields a loss of only $113.08.
</p>

<p>
When price changes are assumed to be normally distributed, the
continuous compounding of these price changes wiU cause the prices at
maturity to be <b>lognormally distributed</b>. 
</p>

<p>
The Black-Scholes Model is a contínuous time model. It assumes at the
volatility of an underlying instrument is constant over the life of
the option, but that this volatility is continuously compounded. These two
assumptions mean that the possible prices of the underlying instrument
at expiration ofthe option are lognormally distributed. 
</p>

<p>
It also explains why options with higher exercise prices caηy more
value than options with lower exercise prices,where both exercise prices
appear to be an identical amount away from the price of the underlying
instrument. 
</p>

<p>
Summarize the most irnportant assurnptions governing price movement
int the Black-Scholes Model:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Changes in the price of an underlying instrurnent are randorn and
cannot be artificially manipulated, nor is it possible to predict
beforehand direction in which prices will move.
</li>
<li>The percent changes in the price of an underlying instrurnent are
norrnally distributed.
</li>
<li>Because the percent changes in the price of the underlying
instrurnent are assumed to be continuously cornpounded, the prices
of the underlying instrument at expiration will be lognormally
distributed.
</li>
<li>The mean of the lognormal distribution will be located at the
forward price of the underlying contract.
</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="sec-4-3">TYPES OF VOLATILITIES</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-3">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Future Volatility: Future volatility is what every trader would like
to know, the volatility at best describes the future distribution of
prices for an underlying contract.
</li>
<li>Historical Volatility
</li>
<li>Forecast Volatility
</li>
<li>Implied Volatility: It is volatility being implied to the
underlying contract through the pricing of the option in the
marketplace. Even though the term premium real1y refers to an
option's price, it is common among traders to refer to the implied
volati1ity as the premium or premium level. If the current implied
volatility is high by historical standards, or high relative to the
recent historical volatility of the underlying contract, a trader
might say that premium levels are high; if implied volatility is
unusuallylow,he might say that premium levels are low.  

<p>
He might
then look at the difference between each option's theoretical value
and its price in marke lace selling any options which were
overpriced relative to the theoretical value, and buying any options
which were underpriced.

<li>Seasonal Volatility:

<h2 id="sec-5">Using an Option's Theoretical Value</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
The purchase or sale of a theoretically mispriced option requires us
to  establish a hedge by taking an opposing positlon in the
underlying contract. When this is done correctly, for small changes
in the price of the underlying, the increase (decrease) in the value
of the optlon position will exactly offset the decrease  (increase) in
the value of the opposing position in the underlying contract. Such a
hedge is unbiased, or <b>neutral</b>, as to the direction of the underlying
contract.
</p>

<p>
The number which enables us to establish a neutral hedge under current
market  conditions is a by-product of theoretical pricing model and is
known as the <b>hedge ratio</b> or, more commonly, the <b>delta</b>. 
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The delta of a call option is always somewhere between 0 and 1.00. 
</li>
<li>The delta of an option can change as market conditions change. 
</li>
<li>An underlying contract always has a delta of 1.00.
