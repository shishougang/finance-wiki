<h3 id="sec-1-1">Contract specifications</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">
<p>
Two <b>types</b>:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Call option: the right to buy or take a long position in a given
asset at a fixed price on or before a specified data.
</li>
<li>Put option: the right to sell or take a short position in a given
asset.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
The <b>difference</b> between an option and a futures contract:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>A futures contract requires delivery at a fixed price. The seller
must make delivery and the buyer must take delivery of the asset.
</li>
<li>The buyer of an option can choose to take delivery(a call) or make
delivery(a put).
</li>
</ol>


<p>
The <b>exercise price</b>, or <b>strike price</b> is the price at which the
underlying will be delivered should the holder of an option choose to
exercise his right to buy or sell.
</p>

<p>
<b>expiration date</b>: The date after which the option may no longer be
exercised is the expiration date.
</p>

<p>
The premium paid for an option can be separated into two components,
the <b>intrinsic value</b> and the <b>time value</b>.
</p>

<p>
The additional amount ofpremium beyond the intrinsic value which
traders are willing to pay for an option is the time value, sometimes
also referred to as the option's time premium or extrinsic value.  
</p>

<p>
An option's premium is always composed of precisely its intrinsic
value and its time value. If a $400 gold call is trading at $50 with gold
at $435 per ounce, the time value of the call must be $15 , since the
intrinsic value is $35. The two components must add up to the option's
total premium of $50. 
</p>

<p>
If the option has no time value,its price will consist solely of
intrinsic value. The option is trading at <b>parity</b>.
</p>

<p>
Any option which has a positive intrinsic value is said to be
<b>in-the-money</b> by the amount of the intrinsic value. An option which
has no intrinsic value is said to be <b>out-of-the-money</b>.
</p>

<p>
An option whose exercise price is identical to the current price of
the underlying contract is said to be <b>at-the-money</b>, such an option
is also out-of-the-money since it has no intrinsic value.
</p>

<p>
The distinction between an at-the-money and out-of-the-money option 
because an at-the-money option has the greatest amount of time premium
and is usually traded very actively.

<h3 id="sec-3-1">THEORETICAL VALUE</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-1">
<p>
The two most common considerations in a financial investment are the
expected return and carrying costs. And, in fact, dividends are an
additional consideration in evaluating options on stock.
</p>

<p>
The goal of option evaluation is to determine, through the use of
theoretical pricing models, the theoretical value of an option. The
trader can then make an intelligent decision whether the option is
overpriced or underpriced in the marketplace, and whether the
theoretical edage is sufficient to justify going into the marketplace
and making a trade.

<h3 id="sec-3-2">A SIMPLE APPROACH</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-2">
<p>
We can now summarize the necessary steps in developing a model: 
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Propose a series of possible prices at expiration for the
underlying contract.
</li>
<li>Assign an appropriate probability to each possible price.
</li>
<li>Maintain an arbitrage-free underlying market.
</li>
<li>From the prices and probabi1ities in steps 1, 2, and 3, calculate
the expected  return for the option.
</li>
<li>From the option's expected return, deduct the carrying cost.

In its original form, the Black-Scholes Model was intended to evaluate
European options (no early exercise permitted) on non-dividend paying
stocks. Shortly after its introduction, realizing that rnost stocks do
pay dividends, Black and Scholes added a dividend cornponent. In 1976,
Fischer Black rnade slight rnodifications to the rnodel to allow for
the evaluation of options on futures contracts. And in 1983, Mark
Garman and Steven Kohlhagen made several other modifications to allow
for the evaluation of options on foreign currencies. The futures
version and the foreign currencyversion are known officially as the
Black Model and the Garman-Kohlhagen Model, respectively. But the
evaluation rnethod in each version, whether the original Black-Scholes
Model for stock options, the Black Model for futures options, or the
Garman-Kohlhagen Model for foreign currency options, is so similar
that they have all come to be known as simply the Black-Scholes Model.
The various forrns of the model differ primarily in how they calculate
the forward price of由eunderlying contract, and an option trader will
simply choose the form appropriate to the underlying instrument.
</p>

<p>
In order to calculate an option's theoretical value using the
Black-Scholes Model, we need to know at a minimum five characteristics
of the option and its underlying contract. There are:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The option's exercise price.
</li>
<li>The amount of time remaining to expiration.
</li>
<li>The current price of the underlying contract.
</li>
<li>The risk-free interest rate over the life of the option.
</li>
<li>The volatility of the underlying contract.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Black and Scholes also incorporated into their model the concept of
the <b>riskless hedge</b>. To take advantage of a theoretically mispriced
option，it is necessary to establish a hedge by offsetting the option
position with this theoretically equivalent underlying position. That
is, whatever option position we take, we must take an opposing market
position in the underlying contract. The correct proportion of
underlying contracts needed to establish this riskless hedge is known
as the <b>hedge ratlo</b>.

<p>
Thís leads to an important distínction between evaluation of an
underlying contract and evaluation of an option. If we assume at
prices are distributed along a normal distribution curve, the value of
an underlying contract depends on where the peak of the curve is
located, while the value of an option depends on how fast le curve
spreads out.

$127.50 after one year,while a continuously compounded rate of return

<p>
When price changes are assumed to be normally distributed, the
continuous compounding of these price changes wiU cause the prices at
maturity to be <b>lognormally distributed</b>. 
</p>

<p>
The Black-Scholes Model is a contínuous time model. It assumes at the
volatility of an underlying instrument is constant over the life of
the option, but that this volatility is continuously compounded. These two
assumptions mean that the possible prices of the underlying instrument
at expiration ofthe option are lognormally distributed.

It also explains why options with higher exercise prices caηy more
value than options with lower exercise prices,where both exercise prices
appear to be an identical amount away from the price of the underlying

<li>Implied Volatility: It is volatility being implied to the
underlying contract through the pricing of the option in the

option's price, it is common among traders to refer to the implied
volati1ity as the premium or premium level. If the current implied
volatility is high by historical standards, or high relative to the
recent historical volatility of the underlying contract, a trader
might say that premium levels are high; if implied volatility is
unusuallylow,he might say that premium levels are low.

He might

<h2 id="sec-5">Using an Option's Theoretical Value</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
The purchase or sale of a theoretically mispriced option requires us
to  establish a hedge by taking an opposing positlon in the
underlying contract. When this is done correctly, for small changes
in the price of the underlying, the increase (decrease) in the value
of the optlon position will exactly offset the decrease  (increase) in
the value of the opposing position in the underlying contract. Such a
hedge is unbiased, or <b>neutral</b>, as to the direction of the underlying
contract.
</p>

<p>
The number which enables us to establish a neutral hedge under current
market  conditions is a by-product of theoretical pricing model and is
known as the <b>hedge ratio</b> or, more commonly, the <b>delta</b>. 
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The delta of a call option is always somewhere between 0 and 1.00. 
</li>
<li>The delta of an option can change as market conditions change. 
</li>
<li>An underlying contract always has a delta of 1.00. 
</li>
</ol>

<p>
The steps we have thus far taken illustrate the correct procedure in
using an option theoretical value:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Purchase (sell) undervalued (overvalued) options.
</li>
<li>Establish a delta neutraI hedge against the underlying contract.
</li>
<li>Adjust the hedge at regular intervals to remain delta neutral.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
At that time we plan to close out the position by:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Letting any out-of-the-money options expire worthless.
</li>
<li>Selling any in-the-money options at parity (intrinsic value) or,
equiva1ently, exercising them and offsetting them against the
underlying futures contract.
</li>
<li>Liquidating any outstanding futures contracts at the market price.
</li>
</ol>


<p>
1n a frictionless market we assume that: 
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Traders can freely buy or sell the underlying contract without
restriction

<li>AlI traders can borrow and lend money at the same rate.

for deeply in-the-money calls, and from zero for far

<p>
At-the-money calls have deltas of approximately 50, and at-the-money
puts approximately -50.

<p>
As time passes,or as we decrease our volatility assumption,call
deltas move away om 50,and puts deltas away from -50. As we increase

</li>
<li>Gamma: At-the-money options have greater gammas than either in- or
out-of-the-money options with otherwise identical contract
specifications.

<p>
As we increase our volati1ity assumptíon, the gamma of an in~ or
out-of~the~money option rises, while gamma of an at le~money option
falls. As we decrease our volatility assumption, or as time to
expiration grows shorter, the gamma of an in~ or out-of~the money

sometimes dramatically.

<li>Theta: At-the~money options have greater etas than either in~ or

The theta of an at-the-money option increases as expiration
approaches. A short-term, at-the-money option will a1 ways decay
more quickly than a long-term, at-the-money option.

<p>
As we increase (decrease) our volatility assumption, the theta of an
option will rise (fall). Higher volatility means there is greater
time value associated with the option, so at each day's decay wil1
also be greater when no movement occurs.

A backspread is a delta neutral spread which consists of more long

A call backspread consists of long calls at a higher exercise price
and short calls at a lower exercise price. A put backspread consists
of long puts at a lower exercise price and short puts at a higher

If we assume that the options making up a time spread are

characteristics:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A long time spread always wants the underlying market sit still. 
Since a short-term at-the-money option always decays more quickly
than a longterm at-the-money option, regardless of whether the
options are calls or puts, both a long call time spread and a long
put time spread want the underlying market to sit sti1l. Ideally,
both spreads would like the short-term option to expire right
at-the-money so that the long-term option will retain as much time
value as possible while the short-term option expires worthless.

</p>
</div>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A long time spread always benefits jrom an increase in implied
volatility.
As time to expiration increases, the vega of an option increases.
This means that a long-term option is always more sensitive in total
points to a change in volatility than a short-term option with the
same exercise price.

<p>
These two opposing forces, the decay in an option's value due to the
passage of time and the change in an option's value due to changes in
volatility, give time spreads their unique characteristics. When a
trader buys or sel1s a time spread, he is not only attempting to
forecast movement in the underlying market. He is剖sotrying to
forecast changes in imp1ied volatility.

<h3 id="sec-8-7">THE EFFECT OF CHANGING INTEREST RATES AND DIVIDENDS</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-8-7">
<p>
If we are considering stock options with different expiration dates,we
mut consider two different forward prices. Andthese two forward prices
may not be equaly sensitive to a change in interest rates. 
</p>

<p>
If interest rates increase，the time spread will widen because the
June forward price will rise more quickly than the March forward
price. Therefore, a long (short) call time spread in the stock option
market must have a positive (negative) rho.
</p>

<p>
if interest rates increase, the put time spread will narrow.
Therefore, a long (short) put time spread in the stock option market
must have a negative (positive) rho.
</p>

<p>
An increase (decrease) in dividends lowers (raises) the forward price
of stock.
</p>

<p>
In a time spread, if a dividend payment is expected between expiration
of the short-term and long-term option, the long-term option will be
affected by the lowered forward price of the stock. Hence, an increase
in dividends, if at least one dividend payment is expected between the
expiration dates, will cause call time spreads to narrow and put time
spreads to widen. A decrease in dividends will have the opposite
effect, with call time spreads widening and put time spreads
narrowing. The effect of changing interest rates and dividends on
stock option time spreads is shown below:

<p>
<b>A Christmas tree</b> (also referred to as a ladd is a term which can be
applied to a variety of spreads. The spread usually consists of three
different exercise prices where all options are of the same type and
expire at the same time. In a long (short) call Christmas tree, one
call is purchased (sold) at the lowest exercise price,and one call is
sold (purchased) at each of the higher exercise prices. In a long
(short) put Christmas tree, one put is purchased (sold) at the highest
exercise price, and one put is sold (purchased) at each of the lower
exercise prices.
</p>


<p>
Long Christmas trees , when done delta neutral， can be thought of as
particular types of ratio vertical spreads. Such spreads therefore
increase in value if the underlying market either sits still or moves
very slowly. Short Christmas trees can be thought of as particular
types of backspreads, and therefore increase in value with big moves
in the underlying market.

Another variation on a butterfly, known as a <b>condor</b>, can be constructed
by splitting the inside exercise prices. Now the position consists of
four options at consecutive exercise prices where the two outside
options are purchased and the two inside options sold (a long condor),
or the two inside options are purchased and the two outside options
sold (a short condor). As with a butterfly, all options must be of the
same type(all calls or all puts) and expire at the same time.

<p>
Ideally, we would like ωconstruct a spread by purchasing options

<p>
If options general/y appear underprtced (low implied volatility),
look for spreads with a positive vega. This includes strategies in

overpriced (high implied volatility)，look for spreads wtth a negative

<h3 id="sec-9-1">CHOOSING THE BEST SPREAD</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-9-1">
<p>
We can summarize these risks as follows: 
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Delta (DirectionaI) Risk-The risk that the underlying market will
move in one direction rather than another. When we create a position
which is delta neutral, we are trying to ensure that initially the
position has no particular preference as to the direction in which
the underlying instrument will move. A delta neutral position does
not necessarily eliminate all directional risk, but it usually
leaves us immune to directional risks within a limited range.
</li>
<li>Gamma (Curvature) Risk -The risk of a large move in the underlying
contract, regardless of direction. The gamma position is a measure
of how sensitive a position is to such large moves. A positive
gamma position does not really have gamma risk since such a position
will, in theory, increase in value with movement in the underlying
contract. A negative gamma position, however, can quickly lose its
theoretical edge with a large move in the underlying contract. The
consequences of such a move must always be a consideration when
analyzing the relative merits of different positions.
</li>
<li>Theta (Time Decay) Risk一Therisk that time will pass with no
movement in the underlying contract.  This is the opposite side of
gamma risk. Positions with positive gamma become more valuable With
large moves in the underlying. But if movement helps, the passage of
time hurts. A positive gamma always goes hand in hand with a
negative theta. A trader with a negative theta will always have to
consider the risk in terms of how much time can pass before the
spread's theoretical edge disappears. The position wants movement,
but if the movement fails to occur within the next day, or next
week, or next month, will be spread, in theory, still be profitable?
</li>
<li>Vega (Volatility) Risk &#x2014; The risk that the volatility which we
input into the theoretical pricing model will be incorrect. If we
input an incorrect volatility, we will be assuming an incorrect
distribution of underlying prices over time. Since some positions
have a positive vega and are hurt by declining volatility, and some
positions have a negative vega and are hurt by rising volatility,
the vega represents a risk to every position. A trader must always
consider how much the volatility can move againsthim before
thepotential profit from a position disappears.
</li>
<li>Rho (Interest Rate) Risk-The risk that interest rates will change
over the life of the option. A position with a positive rho will be
helped (hurt) by an increase (decline) in interest rates, while a
position with a negative rho wil1 show just the opposite
characteristics. Generally, the interest rate is the least
important of the inputs into a theoretical pricing model, and it is
unlikely, except for special situations, that a trader will give
extensive thought to rho risk associated with a position.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-9-2">

all spreads.

<h3 id="sec-9-3">HOW MUCH MARGIN FOR ERROR?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-9-3">

Perhaps a better way to approach the question is to ask not what is a
reasonable margin for error, but rather to ask what is the correct
size in which to do a spread given a known margin for error.

<h3 id="sec-9-5">WHAT IS A GOOD SPREAD?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-9-5">
<p>
It is impossible ωtake into consideration everypossible risk. A
spread which passed every risk test would probably have so little
theoretical edge that it wouldn't be worth doing. But the trader who
allows himself a reasonable margin for error will find that even his
losses will not lead to financial ruin. A good spread is not
necessarily the one that shows the greatest proflt when things go
well; it may be the one which shows the least loss when things go
badly. Winning trades always take care of themselves. Losing trades,
which don't glve back al1 the profits from the winning ones, are just
as important.

<div id="outline-container-sec-9-6" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-9-6">ADJUSTMENTS</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-9-6">
<p>
An adjustment to trader's delta position may reduce his directional
risk, but if he simultaneously increases his gamma, theta, or vega
risk, he may inadvertently be exchanging one type of risk for another. 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A delta adjustment made with the underlying contract is essentially a
risk neutral adjustment.
</li>
<li>An adjustment made with options may reduce the delta risk, but will
also change the other nsk characteristfcs assocíated wtth the
position.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
A disciplined trader knows that sometimes, because of risk
considerations, the best course ls to reduce the size of the spread,
even if it means gi.ving up some theoretical edge. This may be hard on
the trader's ego, particular1y 1f he must personally go back into the
market and either buy back options which he originally sold at a lower
price, or sell out options whîch he originally purchased at a higher
price. However, if a trader is unwilling to swallow his pride from
time to time, and admit that he made a mistake, his trading career is
certain to be a short one. 
</p>

<p>
If a trader finds that any de1ta adjustment in the option market that
reduces his risk will also reduce his theoretical edge，and he is
unwil1ing to give up any theoretical edge, his only recourse is to
make h1s adjustments in the underlying market. An underlying contract
has no gamma, theta, or vega, so the risks of the position will remain
essentially the same.

In practice, however, many option traders begin theîr trading careers
by taking positions in the underlying market, where direction is the
primary consideration. Many traders therefore deve10p a style of
trading based on presumed directional moves in the underlying market.

<h3 id="sec-10-2">BULL AND BEAR RATIO SPREADS</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-10-2">
<p>
If a trader believes that implied volatility is too hlgh, one sensible
strategy is a ratio vertical spread.
</p>

<p>
Even though the trader was correct ín his bullish sentiment, the
position was primarily a volatility spread, so that the volatility
characteristics of the position eventually outweighed any
considerations of market direction.
</p>

<p>
Since this spread is a volatility spread, the primary consideration,
as before, is the volatility of the market. Only secondarily are
we concerned with the direction of movement. If the trader
overestimates volatility, and the market moves more slowly than
expected, the spread which was initially de1ta positive can instead
become delta negative.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-10-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-10-3">BULL AND BEAR BUTTERFLIES AND TlME SPREADS</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-10-3">
<p>
If the  underlying market is currently at 100, he might choose to buy
the June 105/110/115 call butterfly. Since this position wants the
underlying market at 110 at expiration, and it is currently at 100,
the position is a bull butterfly. This will be reflected in the
position having a positive delta.  
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, if the underlying market moves too swift1y, say to 120,
the butterfly can invert from a positive to a negative delta position.
</p>

<p>
Conversely, if the trader is bearish, he can always choose to buy a
butterfly where the inside exercise price is below the current price
of the underlying market. But again, if the market moves down too
quickly and goes through the inside exercise price, the position will
invert from a negative to a positive delta.
</p>

<p>
In a simi1ar manner, a trader can choose time spreads 由atare either
bul1ish or bearish. A long time spread always wants the near-term
contract to  expire exactly at-the-money. A long time spread will be
initial1y bullish if the exercise price of the time spread is above
the current price of the underly1ng market.

<div id="outline-container-sec-10-4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-10-4">VERTICAL SPREADS</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-10-4">
<p>
Vertical spreads are not on1y initially bullish or bearish, but
they remain bullish or bearish no matter how market conditions change. A
vertical spread always consists of one long (purchased) option and one
short (sold) option, where both options are of the same type (either
both calls or both puts) and expire at the same time. The options are
distinguished only by their different exercise prices. Typical vertical
spreads might be:
</p>

<p class="verse">
buy 1 June 100 call<br  />
sell 1 June 105 cal1<br  />
or<br  />
buy 1 March 105 put<br  />
sell 1 March 95 put<br  />
</p>

<p>
If a trader wants to do a vertical spread, he has essentially four
choices. If he is bullish he can choose a bull vertical call spread or
a bull vertical put spread; if he is bearish he can choose a bear
vertical call spread or a bear vertical put spread. For example: 
</p>

<p class="verse">
bull call spread: buy a June 100 call<br  />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;sell  a June 105 call<br  />
bull put spread:  buy a June 100 put<br  />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;sell a June 105 put<br  />
bear call spread: sell a June 100 call<br  />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;buy a June 105 call<br  />
bear put spread:  sell a June 100 put<br  />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;buy a June 105 put<br  />
</p>

<p>
Two factors determine the total directional characteristlcs of a
vertlcal spread: 
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The delta of the specific vertical spread 
</li>
<li>The size in which the spread is executed
</li>
</ol>

<p>
The greater the distance between exercise prices, the greater the
delta value associated with the spread. A 95/110 bull spread wil1 be
more bullish than a 100/110 bull spread, which will, ín turn, be more
bullish than a 100/105 bull spread. 
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="./files/vertical-spread-compare.jpeg" alt="vertical-spread-compare.jpeg" />
</p>
</div>


<p>
Once a trader decides on an expiratlon month in which to  take his
directlonal position, he must decide which specific spread is best.
That is, he must decide which exercise prices to use. A common
approach is focus on the at-the-money optlons. If a trader does this,
he will have the fol1owing choices:
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="./files/at-the-money-vertical-spread.jpeg" alt="at-the-money-vertical-spread.jpeg" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
The reason becomes clear if we recall one of the characteristics of
option evaluation introduced in Chapter 6: If we consider three
options, an in-the-money， at-the-money， and out-of-the-money option
which are identical except for their exercise prices, the at-the-money
option is always the most sensitive in total points to a change in
volatility. 
</p>

<p>
This characteristic leads to a very simple rule for choosing bull and
bear vertical spreads:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
If implied volatility is too low, vertical spreads should focus on purchasing
the at-the-money optlon. If implied volatility is too high, vertical spreads
should focus on selling the at-the-money options.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
A trader is not required to execute any vertical spread by first
buying or selling the at-the-money option. Such spreads always involve
two options, and a trader can choose to either execute the complete
spread in one transaction, or leg into the spread by trading one
option at a time. Regardless of how the spread is executed, the trader
should focus on the at-the-money option, either buying it when implied
volatility is too low, or selling it when implied volatility is too
high.
</p>

<p>
The choice of the at-the-money option is slightly different when we
move to stock options. If we define the at-the-money option as the one
whose de1ta is closest to 50, then we may find at the at-the-money
option is not always the one whose exercise price is closest current
price of the underlying contract. This ís because the option with a
delta closest 50 will be the one whose exercise price ís closest
to forward price of underlying contract. In stock options, the forward
price is the current price of stock, plus carrying costs on the
stock, less expected dividends. 
</p>

<p>
Why míght a trader with a directional opinion prefer a vertical
spread to an outright long or short posítíon in the underlying
instrument? For one thing, a vertical spread is much less risky than
an outright posítion. Atrader who wants to take a position which is
500 deltas long can either buy fíve underlying contracts or buy 25
vertical calI spreads with a delta of 20 each. The 25 vertical spreads
may sound riskier than five underlying contracts, until we remember
at a vertical spread has limited risk whíle the position in
underlying has open-ended risk. Of course,greater risk also means
greater reward. A trader with a long or short position in the
underlyíng market can reap huge rewards if the market makes a large
move in his favor. By contrast,the vertical spreader's profits are
limited,but he will also be much less bloodied if the market makes an
unexpected move in the wrong direction.

price.
</p>

<p>
Rearranging the components of a synthetic underling position, we can
create four other synthetic relationships: 
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>synthetic long call = long an underlylng contract + long put 
</li>
<li>synthetic short call = short an underlying contract + short put 
</li>
<li>synthetic long put = short an underlying contract + long call 
</li>
<li>synthetic short put = long an underlying contract + short call 
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The difference between the call and put price ís often referred to as
the synthettc market. In the absence of any interest or dividend
considerations, the value of the synthetic market can be expressed as: 
</p>

<p>
call price -put price = underlying price - exercise price 
</p>

<p>
If this equality holds, there ís no difference between taking a
position in the underlying market, or taking an equivalent synthetic
position in the option market.
</p>

<p>
The three-sided relationship between a call, a put, and its underlying
contract means that we can always express the value of any one of these
contracts in terms of the other two: 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>underlying price = call prîce - put prîce + exercíse price 
</li>
<li>call prîce = underlying price + put príce - exercíse price 
</li>
<li>put price = call prîce - underlying prîce + exercise price

<p>
When a trader identifies two contracts which are essentially the same
but which are trading at different prices, the natural course ís to
execute an arbitrage by purchasing the cheaper contract and selling the
more expensive. 
</p>

<p>
No matter what happens in the underlying market, the underlying
position will do exactly .25 better than the synthetìc position. The
entire position wíll therefore show a profit of .25, regardless of
movement in the underlying market. 
</p>

<p>
The foregoing position, where the purchase of an underlying contract
is offset by  the sale of a synthetic position, is known as a
<b>conversion</b>. The opposíte position, where the sale of an underlying
contract is offset by the purchase of a synthetic position, is known
as a <b>reverse conversion</b> or, more commonly, a <b>reversal</b>. 
</p>

<p>
Summarizing: 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
conversion  =  long underlying + synthetlc short underlying 
            =  long underlying + short call + long put 
reversal    =  short underlying + synthetic long underlying 
            =  short underlying + long call + short put 
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
As before, we assume that the call and the put have the same exercise
price and expiration date.
</p>

<p>
Typically, an arbitrageur will attempt to simultaneously buy and sell
the same items in different markets to take advantage of price
discrepancies between the two markets.
</p>

<p>
Synthetic positions are often used to  execute conversions and
reversals, so traders sometimes refer to the synthetic market (the
difference between the call price and put price) as the
converston/reversal market. 
</p>

<p>
All experienced traders are familiar with the price relationship
between a synthetic position and its underlying contract, so that any
imbalance in the conversion/reversal market is 1ikely to be
short-lived. If the synthetic is overpriced, all traders will want to
execute a conversion (buy the underlying, sell the call, buy the put).
If the synthetic is underpriced, all traders will want to execute a
reversal (sell the underlying, buy the call, sell the put). Such
activity, where everyone is attempting to  do the same thing, will
quickly force  the synthetic market back to  equilibrium. Indeed,
imbalances in the conversion/reversal market are usually small and
rarely last for  more than a few seconds.

<p>
This will be true if  interest rates are zero, or in  futures  markets

The risk arises because a synthetic position in options and an actual
position in the underlying contract can have different characteristics，
either in terms of settlement procedure, as in the futures option
market, or in terms of the dividend payout, as in the stock option
market. 
</p>

<p>
How might we eliminate this risk?
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
short a call 
long a put 
long an underlying contract

<p>
replace the long underlyingpositlon with a deeply in-the-money call
Now our position is: 
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
short a call 
long a put 
long a deeply in-the-money call 
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
instead  of replacing the  underlying position with a deeply
in-the-money call, we can sell a deeply in-the-money put: 
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
short a cal1 
long a put 
short a deeply in-the-money put 
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This type of position, where the underlying instrument in a conversion
or reversal is replaced with a deeply in-the-money  option, is  known
as a <b>three-way</b>.
</p>

<p>
Suppose we also execute a reversal at 90: 
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
long a June 90 call 
short a June 90 put 
short an underlying contract 
</p>

<p>
short a June 100 call 
long a June 100 put 
long an underlying contract 
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The long and short underlying contracts cancel out, leaving: 
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
long a June 90 call 
short a June 90 put 
</p>

<p>
short a June 100 call 
long a June 100 put
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This position, known as a box, is similar to a conversion or reversal,
except that any risk associated with holding a position in  the
underlyíng contract has been eliminated because the underlying
position has been replaced with a synthetic underlying position at a
different exercise price.
</p>

<p>
Since a box eliminates the risk associated with carrying a position in
the underlying contract, boxes are even less risky than conversions
and reversals, which are themselves low-risk strategies.

Another method of eliminating a position in the underlying contract is
to take a synthetic position in a different expiration month, rather
than at a different exercise price as with a box. 
</p>

<p>
For example, suppose we have executed the following reversal:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
long a June 100 call 
short a June 100 put 
short an underlying contract 
</p>

<p>
short a September 100 call 
long a September 100 put 
long an underlyíng contract
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
If the underlyíng contract for bothJune and Septernber is identical,
theywil1 cancel out, leaving us with: 
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
long a June 100 cal1 
short a June 100 put 
</p>

<p>
short a September 100 cal1 
long a September 100 put
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
These combined long and short synthetic positions taken at the same
exercise prices but in different expiration months is known as a jelly
roll or simplya roll.
</p>

<p>
The value of the roll is the cost of holding the stock for the
three-month period from June to September. 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
jelly roll  = long-term synthetic - short-term synthetic 
            = (long-term call-long-term put) - (short-term call-short-term put) 
            = (long-term call-short-term call) - (long-term put - short-term put)

The importance of early exercise is greatest when the underlying

The simplest wayωhedge an underlying position using optìons is to
purchase either a call to protect a short position, or a put to
protect a long position.
</p>

<p>
Since each strategy combines an underlying position with an option

<p>
A popular strategy, known as a fence, is to simultaneously combine the
purchase of a protective option with the sale ofa covered option. For
example, with an underlying contract at 50, a hedger with a long
position might choose to simultaneously sell a 55 call and purchase a
45 put. 
</p>

<p>
Fences are popular hedging tools because they offer known protection
at alow cost, or even a credit. At the same time ，they still allow a
hedger to participate, at least partially, in favorable market
movement. Fences go by a variety of names: range forwards, tunnels,
cylinders; among floor traders they are sometimes known as split
price conversions and reversals.

<p>
As a first step in choosing a strategy, a hedger might consider the
following:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Does the hedge need to offer protection against a I'worst case"
scenario?
</li>
<li>How much of the current directional risk should the hedge
eliminate?
</li>
<li>What additional risks is the hedger willing to accept?
</li>
</ol>

<p>
ll otnel ctors being equal, in a high implied volatility market a hedger
should buy as few options as possible and sell as many options as
possible. Conversely, in a low implied volatility market a hedger
should buy as many options as possible and sell as few options as
possible.
</p>

<p>
A hedger who constructs a position with unlimited risk in either
direction is presumably taking a volatility position. There is nothing
wrong with this, since volatility trading can be highly profitable.
But a true hedger ought not lose sight of what his ultimate goal is:
to protect an existing position, and to keep the cost of this
protection as low as possible.

if he wants to replicate the combination of the underlying asset and
the 100 put, he must sell off 43% of his holdings in the asset. When
he does that, he will have a position theoretically equivalent to
owning a 100 call.
</p>

<p>
This process ofcontinuously rehedging an underlying position to
replicate an option position is often referred to as portfolio
insurance. 
</p>

<p>
If the mix of securities in a portfolio approximates an index, and
futures contracts are available on that index, the manager can
approximate the results of portfolio insurance by purchaslng or
selling futures contracts to increase or decrease the holdings in his
portfolio. 
</p>

<p>
Even if options are available on an underlying asset, a hedger may
still choose to effect a portfolio insurance strategy himself rather
then purchasing the option in the marketplace. For one thing, he may
consider the option too expensive. If he believes the option is
theoretically overpriced, in the long run it will be cheaper to
continuously rehedge the portfo1io. Or he may find insufficient
liquidity in the option market to absorb the number of option contracts
he needs to hedge his position. Finally, the expiration of options
which are available may not exactly correspond to the period over
which he wants to protect his position. If an option is available, but
expires earlier than desired, the hedger might still choose to
purchase options in marketplace, and then pursue a portfolio insurance
strategy over the period following the option's expiration.

This type of trading strategy, where one buys or sells a mispriced stock

often be programmed to calculate the fair value of a futures contract,
and to execute the arbitrage when the futures contract is mispriced,

What matters is that the marketplace believes that the market will
