#+TITLE: Option Volatility & Pricing, Advanced Trading Strategies and Techniques

* The language of options
** Contract specifications
Two *types*:
1. Call option: the right to buy or take a long position in a given
   asset at a fixed price on or before a specified data.
2. Put option: the right to sell or take a short position in a given
   asset.

The *difference* between an option and a futures contract:
1. A futures contract requires delivery at a fixed price. The seller
   must make delivery and the buyer must take delivery of the asset.
2. The buyer of an option can choose to take delivery(a call) or make
   delivery(a put).


The *exercise price*, or *strike price* is the price at which the
underlying will be delivered should the holder of an option choose to
exercise his right to buy or sell.

*expiration date*: The date after which the option may no longer be
exercised is the expiration date.

The premium paid for an option can be separated into two components,
the *intrinsic value* and the *time value*.

The additional amount ofpremium beyond the intrinsic value which
traders are willing to pay for an option is the time value, sometimes
also referred to as the option's time premium or extrinsic value.  

An option's premium is always composed of precisely its intrinsic
value and its time value. If a $400 gold call is trading at $50 with gold
at $435 per ounce, the time value of the call must be $15 , since the
intrinsic value is $35. The two components must add up to the option's
total premium of $50. 

If the option has no time value,its price will consist solely of
intrinsic value. The option is trading at *parity*.

Any option which has a positive intrinsic value is said to be
*in-the-money* by the amount of the intrinsic value. An option which
has no intrinsic value is said to be *out-of-the-money*.

An option whose exercise price is identical to the current price of
the underlying contract is said to be *at-the-money*, such an option
is also out-of-the-money since it has no intrinsic value.

The distinction between an at-the-money and out-of-the-money option 
because an at-the-money option has the greatest amount of time premium
and is usually traded very actively.

** MARGIN REQUIREMENTS
When a trader makes an opening trade on an exchange, the exchange may
require the trader to deposit some amount of *margin*, or good faith
capital.

** CONSTRUCT AN EXPlRATION GRAPH
1. If the graph bends, it wìll do so at an exercise price. Therefore,
   we can calculate the proflt or 10ss at each exercise price involved
   and simply connect these points with straight lines.
2. If the position is 10ng and short equa1 numbers of cal1s (puts),
   the potential downside (upside) risk or reward wi11be equal ωthe
   total debit or credit required to establish the position.
3. Ab ove highest exercise price all calls will go into-the-money, so
   the entire position will act like an underlying position which is
   either long or short underlying contracts equal to the number of
   net long or short calls. Below the lowest exercise price all puts
   will go into-the-money, so the entire position will act like an
   underlying position which is either long or short underlying
   contracts equal to the number of net long or short puts.

* Introduction to Theoretical Pricing Models
If he purchases options, not only must he be right about market
direction, he must also be right about *market speed*. 

The minimum factors you must consider:
1. The price of the underlying contract.
2. The exercise price.
3. The amount of time remaining to expiration.
4. The direction in which he expects the underlying market move.
5. The speed at which he expects the underlying market to move.

** THEORETICAL VALUE 
The two most common considerations in a financial investment are the
expected return and carrying costs. And, in fact, dividends are an
additional consideration in evaluating options on stock.

The goal of option evaluation is to determine, through the use of
theoretical pricing models, the theoretical value of an option. The
trader can then make an intelligent decision whether the option is
overpriced or underpriced in the marketplace, and whether the
theoretical edage is sufficient to justify going into the marketplace
and making a trade.

** A SIMPLE APPROACH
We can now summarize the necessary steps in developing a model: 
1.  Propose a series of possible prices at expiration for the
    underlying contract.
2.  Assign an appropriate probability to each possible price.
3.  Maintain an arbitrage-free underlying market.
4.  From the prices and probabi1ities in steps 1, 2, and 3, calculate
    the expected  return for the option.
5.  From the option's expected return, deduct the carrying cost.

In its original form, the Black-Scholes Model was intended to evaluate
European options (no early exercise permitted) on non-dividend paying
stocks. Shortly after its introduction, realizing that rnost stocks do
pay dividends, Black and Scholes added a dividend cornponent. In 1976,
Fischer Black rnade slight rnodifications to the rnodel to allow for
the evaluation of options on futures contracts. And in 1983, Mark
Garman and Steven Kohlhagen made several other modifications to allow
for the evaluation of options on foreign currencies. The futures
version and the foreign currencyversion are known officially as the
Black Model and the Garman-Kohlhagen Model, respectively. But the
evaluation rnethod in each version, whether the original Black-Scholes
Model for stock options, the Black Model for futures options, or the
Garman-Kohlhagen Model for foreign currency options, is so similar
that they have all come to be known as simply the Black-Scholes Model.
The various forrns of the model differ primarily in how they calculate
the forward price of由eunderlying contract, and an option trader will
simply choose the form appropriate to the underlying instrument.

In order to calculate an option's theoretical value using the
Black-Scholes Model, we need to know at a minimum five characteristics
of the option and its underlying contract. There are:

1. The option's exercise price.
2. The amount of time remaining to expiration.
3. The current price of the underlying contract.
4. The risk-free interest rate over the life of the option.
5. The volatility of the underlying contract.

Black and Scholes also incorporated into their model the concept of
the *riskless hedge*. To take advantage of a theoretically mispriced
option，it is necessary to establish a hedge by offsetting the option
position with this theoretically equivalent underlying position. That
is, whatever option position we take, we must take an opposing market
position in the underlying contract. The correct proportion of
underlying contracts needed to establish this riskless hedge is known
as the *hedge ratlo*.

* Volatility
** RANDOM WALKS AND NORMAL DISTRIBUTIONS
Thís leads to an important distínction between evaluation of an
underlying contract and evaluation of an option. If we assume at
prices are distributed along a normal distribution curve, the value of
an underlying contract depends on where the peak of the curve is
located, while the value of an option depends on how fast le curve
spreads out.

** LOGNORMAL DISTRIBUTIONS
A continuously compounded rate of return of +12% yields a profit of
$127.50 after one year,while a continuously compounded rate of return
of -12% yields a loss of only $113.08.

When price changes are assumed to be normally distributed, the
continuous compounding of these price changes wiU cause the prices at
maturity to be *lognormally distributed*. 

The Black-Scholes Model is a contínuous time model. It assumes at the
volatility of an underlying instrument is constant over the life of
the option, but that this volatility is continuously compounded. These two
assumptions mean that the possible prices of the underlying instrument
at expiration ofthe option are lognormally distributed. 

It also explains why options with higher exercise prices caηy more
value than options with lower exercise prices,where both exercise prices
appear to be an identical amount away from the price of the underlying
instrument. 

Summarize the most irnportant assurnptions governing price movement
int the Black-Scholes Model:

1. Changes in the price of an underlying instrurnent are randorn and
   cannot be artificially manipulated, nor is it possible to predict
   beforehand direction in which prices will move.
2. The percent changes in the price of an underlying instrurnent are
   norrnally distributed.
3. Because the percent changes in the price of the underlying
   instrurnent are assumed to be continuously cornpounded, the prices
   of the underlying instrument at expiration will be lognormally
   distributed.
4. The mean of the lognormal distribution will be located at the
   forward price of the underlying contract.

** TYPES OF VOLATILITIES
+ Future Volatility: Future volatility is what every trader would like
  to know, the volatility at best describes the future distribution of
  prices for an underlying contract.
+ Historical Volatility
+ Forecast Volatility
+ Implied Volatility: It is volatility being implied to the
  underlying contract through the pricing of the option in the
  marketplace. Even though the term premium real1y refers to an
  option's price, it is common among traders to refer to the implied
  volati1ity as the premium or premium level. If the current implied
  volatility is high by historical standards, or high relative to the
  recent historical volatility of the underlying contract, a trader
  might say that premium levels are high; if implied volatility is
  unusuallylow,he might say that premium levels are low.  
  
  He might
  then look at the difference between each option's theoretical value
  and its price in marke lace selling any options which were
  overpriced relative to the theoretical value, and buying any options
  which were underpriced. 
+ Seasonal Volatility: 
* Using an Option's Theoretical Value
The purchase or sale of a theoretically mispriced option requires us
to  establish a hedge by taking an opposing positlon in the
underlying contract. When this is done correctly, for small changes
in the price of the underlying, the increase (decrease) in the value
of the optlon position will exactly offset the decrease  (increase) in
the value of the opposing position in the underlying contract. Such a
hedge is unbiased, or *neutral*, as to the direction of the underlying
contract.

The number which enables us to establish a neutral hedge under current
market  conditions is a by-product of theoretical pricing model and is
known as the *hedge ratio* or, more commonly, the *delta*. 

1. The delta of a call option is always somewhere between 0 and 1.00. 
2. The delta of an option can change as market conditions change. 
3. An underlying contract always has a delta of 1.00. 

The steps we have thus far taken illustrate the correct procedure in
using an option theoretical value:
1. Purchase (sell) undervalued (overvalued) options.
2. Establish a delta neutraI hedge against the underlying contract.
3. Adjust the hedge at regular intervals to remain delta neutral.

At that time we plan to close out the position by:
1. Letting any out-of-the-money options expire worthless.
2. Selling any in-the-money options at parity (intrinsic value) or,
   equiva1ently, exercising them and offsetting them against the
   underlying futures contract.
3. Liquidating any outstanding futures contracts at the market price.


1n a frictionless market we assume that: 
1.  Traders can freely buy or sell the underlying contract without
    restriction 
2.  AlI traders can borrow and lend money at the same rate. 
3.  Transaction costs are zero. 
4.  There are no tax considerations. 
* Option Values and Changing Market Conditions 
** THE DELTA
three interpretations of delta:
+ the hedge ratio
+ Rate of Change in the theoretical value: The de1ta is a measure of how an optio 's value
  changes with respect to a change in the price of the underlying
  contract.
+ Theoretical or Equivalent Underlying Position 
** THE GAMMA
The gamma sometimes referred to as the curvature of an option,
is the rate at which an option's delta changes as the price of the
underlying changes. 

If an option has a gamrna of 5for each point rise (fal1) in the price
of the und.erlying,the option will gain (lose) 5 de1tas.

Every option trader learns to look carefully not only at current
directional risk (the delta), but also at how that directional risk
will change if the underlying market begins ωmove (the gamma).
** THE THETA
The *theta(θ)* ，or tíme decay factor,is the rate at which an
option loses value as time passes.
** THE VEGA OR KAPPA
The *vega* of an option is usually given in point change ín theoretical
value for each one percentage point change in volatility.

Since vega is not a Greek letter, a common alternative in academic
literature, where Greek letters are preferred, is kappa (K).
** THE RHO
The sensitivity of an optio 's theoretical value to a change in
interest rates is given by its rho (P).
** SUMMARY
+ Delta: Deltas range from zero for far out-of.the-money calls to 100
  for deeply in-the-money calls, and from zero for far
  out-of-the-money puts to -100 for deeply in-the-money puts.

  At-the-money calls have deltas of approximately 50, and at-the-money
  puts approximately -50.

  As time passes,or as we decrease our volatility assumption,call
  deltas move away om 50,and puts deltas away from -50. As we increase
  our volatility assumption, cal1 deltas move towards 50, and put
  deltas towards -50.
+ Gamma: At-the-money options have greater gammas than either in- or
  out-of-the-money options with otherwise identical contract
  specifications.

  As we increase our volati1ity assumptíon, the gamma of an in~ or
  out-of~the~money option rises, while gamma of an at le~money option
  falls. As we decrease our volatility assumption, or as time to
  expiration grows shorter, the gamma of an in~ or out-of~the money
  option falls, while the gamma of an at~the-money option rises,
  sometimes dramatically.
+ Theta: At-the~money options have greater etas than either in~ or
  out~ofthe-money options with otherwise identical contract
  specifications.

  The theta of an at-the-money option increases as expiration
  approaches. A short-term, at-the-money option will a1 ways decay
  more quickly than a long-term, at-the-money option.
  
  As we increase (decrease) our volatility assumption, the theta of an
  option will rise (fall). Higher volatility means there is greater
  time value associated with the option, so at each day's decay wil1
  also be greater when no movement occurs.
+ Vega: At-the-money options have greater vegas than either in- or
  out-ofthe-money options With otherwise identical contract
  specifications.
  
  Out-of-the-money options have the greatest vega as apercent of
  theoretical value.

The various positions and their respective signs are given in Figure
6-26. The sign of the delta， gamma, theta, or vega, toge er with the
magnitude of the numbers, tel1 the trader which changes in market
conditions will either help or hurt his position, and to what degree.
The positive or negative effect of changing market conditions is
summarized in Figure 6-27.


[[./files/option-variable.jpg]]

An option's *elasticity*, sometimes denoted with the Greek letter
omega(or less commonly the Greek letter lambda), is the relative
percent change in an option's value for a given percent change in the
price of the underlying contract.

The elasticity is sometimes referred to as the option's *leverage
value*. The greater an option's elasticity, the more highly leverage
the option.

An easy method of calculating:

elasticity = (underlying price) / (theoretical value) * delta

* Introduction to Spreading
Spreading is simply a way of enabling an optlon trader to take
advantage of theoretlcally mispriced options, while at the same time
reducing the effects of short-term changes in market conditions so
that he can safely hold an optlon positlon to maturity.

** WHY SPREAD?
At some point the intelligent trader will have to consider not only
the potential profit, but also the risk  associated with a strategy.

No trader will survive very long if his livelihood depends on
estimating each input with 100% accuracy. Even when he incorrectly
estimates the inputs, the experienced trader can survive if he has
constructed intelligent spread strategies which allow for a wide
margin of error.

* Volatility Spreads
Regardless ofwhich method we choose, each spread will  have certain
features in common: 

+ Eachspread will be approximately delta neutral. 
+ Each spread will be sensitive to  changes in  the  price of the
  underlying instrument.
+ Each spread will be sensitive to changes in implied volatility.
+ Each spread wil1  be sensitive to the passage of time.

** BACKSPREAD
A backspread is a delta neutral spread which consists of more long
(purchased) options than short (sold) options where all options expire
at the same time. 

A call backspread consists of long calls at a higher exercise price
and short calls at a lower exercise price. A put backspread consists
of long puts at a lower exercise price and short puts at a higher
exercise price. 


If no movement occurs, a backspread is likely to be a losing strategy. 

[[./files/call-backspread.jpeg]]

[[./files/put-backspread.jpeg]]

A trader will tend ωchoose the type ofbackspread which reflects his
opinion about market direction. If he foresees a market with great
upside potential, he will tend to choose a call backspread; if he
foresees a market with great downside potential he will tend to choose
a put backspread. He will avoid backspreads in quiet markets since the
underlying contract is unlikely to move very far in either direction. 

** RATIO VERTICAL SPREAD
A trader who takes the opposite side of a backspread also has a delta
neutral spread, but he is short more contracts than long, with all
options expiring at the same time. Such a spread is sometimes referred
to as a ratio spread or a vertical spread.

Designate the opposite of a backspread as a ratio vertical spread.

[[./files/call-ratio-vertical-spread.jpeg]]

[[./files/put-ratio-vertical-spread.jpeg]]

** STRADDLE
A straddle consists of either a long call and a long put, or a short
call and a short put, where both options have the same exercise price
and expire at the same time. 

If both the call and put are purchased, the trader is said to be long
the straddle; if both options are sold, the trader is said to be short
the straddle. 

[[./files/long-straddle.jpeg]]

[[./files/short-straddle.jpeg]]

** STRANGLE
Like a straddle, a strangle consists of a long call and a long put, or
a short call and a short put, where both options expire at the same
time. In a strangle, however， the options have different exercise
prices. If both options are purchased, the trader is long the
strangle if both options are sold, the trader is short the strangle.

[[./files/long-strangle.jpeg]]

[[./files/short-strangle.jpeg]]

To avoid confusion a strangle is commonly assumed to consist of
out-the-money options. If the underlying market is current1y at 100
and a trader wants to purchase the June 95/105 strangle, it is assumed
that he wants to purchase a June 95 put and a June 105 call. When both
options are in-the-money, the position is sometimes referred to as a
*guts*.

** BUTTERFLY
A butterfly consists of options at three equally spaced exercise
prices, where all options are of the same type (either all calls or
all puts) and expire at the same time.

In a long butterfly the outside exercise prices are purchased and the
insíde exercise price is s01d, and vice versa for a short butterfly.

It is always 1 x 2 x 1, with two of each inside exercise price traded
for each one of the outside exercíse prices. If the ratio is other
than 1 x 2 x 1, the spread is no longer a butterfly. 

[[./files/long-butterfly.jpeg]]

[[./files/short-butterfly.jpeg]]

a long butterfly tends to act like a ratio vertica1 spread and a short
butterfly tends to act like a backspread.
** TIME SPREAD (calendar spread or horizontal spread)
Time spreads, sometimes referred to as calendar spreads or horizontal
spreads, consist of opposing positions whlch expire in different
months. The most common type of time spread consists o

The most common type of time spread consists of opposing positions in
two options of the same type  (either both calls or both puts) where
both options have the same exercise price. When the long-term option
is purchased and the short-term option is sold, a trader is long the
time spread; when the short-term option is purchased and the long-term
option is sold, the trader is short the time spread. 



[[./files/long-time-spread.jpeg]]

[[./files/short-time-spread.jpeg]]


 If we assume that the options making up a time spread are
 approxjmately at-the-money, time spreads have two important
 characteristics:

+ A long time spread always wants the underlying market sit still. 
  Since a short-term at-the-money option always decays more quickly
  than a longterm at-the-money option, regardless of whether the
  options are calls or puts, both a long call time spread and a long
  put time spread want the underlying market to sit sti1l. Ideally,
  both spreads would like the short-term option to expire right
  at-the-money so that the long-term option will retain as much time
  value as possible while the short-term option expires worthless. 

[[./files/effect-of-time-passage-time-spreads.jpeg]]

+ A long time spread always benefits jrom an increase in implied
  volatility.
  As time to expiration increases, the vega of an option increases.
  This means that a long-term option is always more sensitive in total
  points to a change in volatility than a short-term option with the
  same exercise price. 

[[./files/effect-of-volatility-time-spreads.jpeg]]


These two opposing forces, the decay in an option's value due to the
passage of time and the change in an option's value due to changes in
volatility, give time spreads their unique characteristics. When a
trader buys or sel1s a time spread, he is not only attempting to
forecast movement in the underlying market. He is剖sotrying to
forecast changes in imp1ied volatility.

** THE EFFECT OF CHANGING INTEREST RATES AND DIVIDENDS
If we are considering stock options with different expiration dates,we
mut consider two different forward prices. Andthese two forward prices
may not be equaly sensitive to a change in interest rates. 

If interest rates increase，the time spread will widen because the
June forward price will rise more quickly than the March forward
price. Therefore, a long (short) call time spread in the stock option
market must have a positive (negative) rho.

if interest rates increase, the put time spread will narrow.
Therefore, a long (short) put time spread in the stock option market
must have a negative (positive) rho.

An increase (decrease) in dividends lowers (raises) the forward price
of stock.

In a time spread, if a dividend payment is expected between expiration
of the short-term and long-term option, the long-term option will be
affected by the lowered forward price of the stock. Hence, an increase
in dividends, if at least one dividend payment is expected between the
expiration dates, will cause call time spreads to narrow and put time
spreads to widen. A decrease in dividends will have the opposite
effect, with call time spreads widening and put time spreads
narrowing. The effect of changing interest rates and dividends on
stock option time spreads is shown below:

[[./files/effects-interest-rates-dividends-time-spreads.jpg]]

** DIAGONAL SPREADS
A diagonal spread Is similar to a time spread, except that the options
have different exercise prices.

** OTHER VARIATIONS
*A Christmas tree* (also referred to as a ladd is a term which can be
applied to a variety of spreads. The spread usually consists of three
different exercise prices where all options are of the same type and
expire at the same time. In a long (short) call Christmas tree, one
call is purchased (sold) at the lowest exercise price,and one call is
sold (purchased) at each of the higher exercise prices. In a long
(short) put Christmas tree, one put is purchased (sold) at the highest
exercise price, and one put is sold (purchased) at each of the lower
exercise prices.


Long Christmas trees , when done delta neutral， can be thought of as
particular types of ratio vertical spreads. Such spreads therefore
increase in value if the underlying market either sits still or moves
very slowly. Short Christmas trees can be thought of as particular
types of backspreads, and therefore increase in value with big moves
in the underlying market.

[[./files/christmas-trees.jpg]]


It is possible to construct a spread which has the same
characteristics as a butterfly by purchasing a straddle (strangle)
and selling a strangle (straddle) where the straddle is executed at
an exercise price midway between the strangle's exercise prices. All
options must expire at the same time. Because the position wants the
same outcome as a butterfly, it is known as an *iron butterfly*.

[[./files/iron-butterffiles.jpg]]

Another variation on a butterfly, known as a *condor*, can be constructed
by splitting the inside exercise prices. Now the position consists of
four options at consecutive exercise prices where the two outside
options are purchased and the two inside options sold (a long condor),
or the two inside options are purchased and the two outside options
sold (a short condor). As with a butterfly, all options must be of the
same type(all calls or all puts) and expire at the same time.

** SPREAD SENSITIVITIES

[[./files/category-gamma-vega.jpg]]

[[./files/charact-volatility-spreads.jpg]]

** CHOOSING AN APPROPRlATE STRATEGY
With so many spreads avai1 able, how do we know which type of spread
is best? 

Ideally, we would like ωconstruct a spread by purchasing options
which are underpriced and se1li ng options which are overpriced. 

If options general/y appear underprtced (low implied volatility),
look for spreads with a positive vega. This includes strategies in
backspread or long time spread category. !f options generally appear
overpriced (high implied volatility)，look for spreads wtth a negative
vega. This includes strategies in the ratio vertical or short time
spread category.

Long time spreads are likely to be profitable when implied
volatility is low but is expected to rise; short time spreads are
likely to be profttable when implied volatility is high but is
expected to fail.
** ADJUSTMENTS
The optimum use of a theoretical pricing model requires a trader to
continuously maintain a delta neutral position throughout the life of
the spread.

1. Adjust at regular intervals -- In theory, the adjustment process is
   assumed to be continuous because volatility is assumed to be a
   continuous measure of the speed of the market.
2. Adjust when the positlon becomes a predetermlned number 01 deltas
   or short.
3. Adjust by feel.

** ENTERING A SPREAD ORDER
The following contingency orders, all ofwhich are defined in Appendix
A, are often used in option markets: 

#+begin_verse
All  Or None 
Fill Or Kill 
Immediate Or Cancel 
Market If Touched

* Risk Considerations
** CHOOSING THE BEST SPREAD
We can summarize these risks as follows: 
+ Delta (DirectionaI) Risk-The risk that the underlying market will
  move in one direction rather than another. When we create a position
  which is delta neutral, we are trying to ensure that initially the
  position has no particular preference as to the direction in which
  the underlying instrument will move. A delta neutral position does
  not necessarily eliminate all directional risk, but it usually
  leaves us immune to directional risks within a limited range.
+ Gamma (Curvature) Risk -The risk of a large move in the underlying
  contract, regardless of direction. The gamma position is a measure
  of how sensitive a position is to such large moves. A positive
  gamma position does not really have gamma risk since such a position
  will, in theory, increase in value with movement in the underlying
  contract. A negative gamma position, however, can quickly lose its
  theoretical edge with a large move in the underlying contract. The
  consequences of such a move must always be a consideration when
  analyzing the relative merits of different positions.
+ Theta (Time Decay) Risk一Therisk that time will pass with no
  movement in the underlying contract.  This is the opposite side of
  gamma risk. Positions with positive gamma become more valuable With
  large moves in the underlying. But if movement helps, the passage of
  time hurts. A positive gamma always goes hand in hand with a
  negative theta. A trader with a negative theta will always have to
  consider the risk in terms of how much time can pass before the
  spread's theoretical edge disappears. The position wants movement,
  but if the movement fails to occur within the next day, or next
  week, or next month, will be spread, in theory, still be profitable?
+ Vega (Volatility) Risk --- The risk that the volatility which we
  input into the theoretical pricing model will be incorrect. If we
  input an incorrect volatility, we will be assuming an incorrect
  distribution of underlying prices over time. Since some positions
  have a positive vega and are hurt by declining volatility, and some
  positions have a negative vega and are hurt by rising volatility,
  the vega represents a risk to every position. A trader must always
  consider how much the volatility can move againsthim before
  thepotential profit from a position disappears.
+ Rho (Interest Rate) Risk-The risk that interest rates will change
  over the life of the option. A position with a positive rho will be
  helped (hurt) by an increase (decline) in interest rates, while a
  position with a negative rho wil1 show just the opposite
  characteristics. Generally, the interest rate is the least
  important of the inputs into a theoretical pricing model, and it is
  unlikely, except for special situations, that a trader will give
  extensive thought to rho risk associated with a position.

** PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
While there is no substitute for experience, most traders quickly
learn an important rule: straddles and strangles are the riskiest of 
all spreads.

** HOW MUCH MARGIN FOR ERROR?
Perhaps a better way to approach the question is to ask not what is a
reasonable margin for error, but rather to ask what is the correct
size in which to do a spread given a known margin for error.

** DIVIDENDS AND INTEREST
** WHAT IS A GOOD SPREAD? 
It is impossible ωtake into consideration everypossible risk. A
spread which passed every risk test would probably have so little
theoretical edge that it wouldn't be worth doing. But the trader who
allows himself a reasonable margin for error will find that even his
losses will not lead to financial ruin. A good spread is not
necessarily the one that shows the greatest proflt when things go
well; it may be the one which shows the least loss when things go
badly. Winning trades always take care of themselves. Losing trades,
which don't glve back al1 the profits from the winning ones, are just
as important.
** ADJUSTMENTS
An adjustment to trader's delta position may reduce his directional
risk, but if he simultaneously increases his gamma, theta, or vega
risk, he may inadvertently be exchanging one type of risk for another. 

+ A delta adjustment made with the underlying contract is essentially a
  risk neutral adjustment.
+ An adjustment made with options may reduce the delta risk, but will
  also change the other nsk characteristfcs assocíated wtth the
  position.

A disciplined trader knows that sometimes, because of risk
considerations, the best course ls to reduce the size of the spread,
even if it means gi.ving up some theoretical edge. This may be hard on
the trader's ego, particular1y 1f he must personally go back into the
market and either buy back options which he originally sold at a lower
price, or sell out options whîch he originally purchased at a higher
price. However, if a trader is unwilling to swallow his pride from
time to time, and admit that he made a mistake, his trading career is
certain to be a short one. 

If a trader finds that any de1ta adjustment in the option market that
reduces his risk will also reduce his theoretical edge，and he is
unwil1ing to give up any theoretical edge, his only recourse is to
make h1s adjustments in the underlying market. An underlying contract
has no gamma, theta, or vega, so the risks of the position will remain
essentially the same.

** A QUESTION OF STYLE
In practice, however, many option traders begin theîr trading careers
by taking positions in the underlying market, where direction is the
primary consideration. Many traders therefore deve10p a style of
trading based on presumed directional moves in the underlying market.
A trader might，for examp1e, be a trend follower, adhering to the
philosophy that "the trend is your friend." Or he might be a
contrarian. preferring to "buy weakness, sell strength." 
** LIQUIDITY
An important consideration in deciding whether to enter into a trade
is often the ease with which the trader can reverse the trade. Liquid
option markets, where there are many buyers and sellers, are much less
risky than illiquid markets, where there are few buyers and sellers.
In the same way, a spread which consists of very liquid options is
much less risky出ana spread which consists of one or more illiquid
options.

* Bull and Bear Spreads
** NAKED POSITIONS 
If all options are overpríced (high implied volatility), we might
sell puts to create a bullish position, or sel1 calls to create a
bearish position. If al1  options are underpriced (low implied
volatility), we might buy calls ωcreate a bullish position, or 
buy puts to create a bearish position. 

The problem with this approach is that，as with all non-hedged
positions, there is very llttle margin error.

** BULL AND BEAR RATIO SPREADS
If a trader believes that implied volatility is too hlgh, one sensible
strategy is a ratio vertical spread.

Even though the trader was correct ín his bullish sentiment, the
position was primarily a volatility spread, so that the volatility
characteristics of the position eventually outweighed any
considerations of market direction.

Since this spread is a volatility spread, the primary consideration,
as before, is the volatility of the market. Only secondarily are
we concerned with the direction of movement. If the trader
overestimates volatility, and the market moves more slowly than
expected, the spread which was initially de1ta positive can instead
become delta negative.

** BULL AND BEAR BUTTERFLIES AND TlME SPREADS
If the  underlying market is currently at 100, he might choose to buy
the June 105/110/115 call butterfly. Since this position wants the
underlying market at 110 at expiration, and it is currently at 100,
the position is a bull butterfly. This will be reflected in the
position having a positive delta.  

Unfortunately, if the underlying market moves too swift1y, say to 120,
the butterfly can invert from a positive to a negative delta position.

Conversely, if the trader is bearish, he can always choose to buy a
butterfly where the inside exercise price is below the current price
of the underlying market. But again, if the market moves down too
quickly and goes through the inside exercise price, the position will
invert from a negative to a positive delta.

In a simi1ar manner, a trader can choose time spreads 由atare either
bul1ish or bearish. A long time spread always wants the near-term
contract to  expire exactly at-the-money. A long time spread will be
initial1y bullish if the exercise price of the time spread is above
the current price of the underly1ng market.

** VERTICAL SPREADS 
Vertical spreads are not on1y initially bullish or bearish, but
they remain bullish or bearish no matter how market conditions change. A
vertical spread always consists of one long (purchased) option and one
short (sold) option, where both options are of the same type (either
both calls or both puts) and expire at the same time. The options are
distinguished only by their different exercise prices. Typical vertical
spreads might be:

#+begin_verse
buy 1 June 100 call 
se111 June 105 cal1 
or 
buy 1 March 105 put 
se111 March 95 put
#+end_verse

If a trader wants to do a vertical spread, he has essentially four
choices. If he is bullish he can choose a bull vertical call spread or
a bull vertical put spread; if he is bearish he can choose a bear
vertical call spread or a bear vertical put spread. For example: 

#+begin_verse
bull call spread: buy a June 100 call 
                  sell  a June 105 call 
bull put spread:  buy a June 100 put 
                  sell a June 105 put 
bear call spread: sell a June 100 call 
                  buy a June 105 call 
bear put spread:  sell a June 100 put 
                  buy a June 105 put
#+end_verse

Two factors determine the total directional characteristlcs of a
vertlcal spread: 
1. The delta of the specific vertical spread 
2. The size in which the spread is executed

The greater the distance between exercise prices, the greater the
delta value associated with the spread. A 95/110 bull spread wil1 be
more bullish than a 100/110 bull spread, which will, ín turn, be more
bullish than a 100/105 bull spread.

Once a trader decides on an expiratlon month in which to  take his
directlonal position, he must decide which specific spread is best.
That is, he must decide which exercise prices to use. A common
approach is focus on the at-the-money optlons. If a trader does this,
he will have the fol1owing choices:

[[./files/at-the-money-vertical-spread.jpeg]]

The reason becomes clear if we recall one of the characteristics of
option evaluation introduced in Chapter 6: If we consider three
options, an in-the-money， at-the-money， and out-of-the-money option
which are identical except for their exercise prices, the at-the-money
option is always the most sensitive in total points to a change in
volatility. 

This characteristic leads to a very simple rule for choosing bull and
bear vertical spreads:

#+begin_quote
If implied volatility is too low, vertical spreads should focus on purchasing
the at-the-money optlon. If implied volatility is too high, vertical spreads
should focus on selling the at-the-money options.
