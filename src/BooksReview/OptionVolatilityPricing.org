* The language of options

** Contract specifications
Two *types*:
1. Call option: the right to buy or take a long position in a given
   asset at a fixed price on or before a specified data.
2. Put option: the right to sell or take a short position in a given
   asset.

The *difference* between an option and a futures contract:
1. A futures contract requires delivery at a fixed price. The seller
   must make delivery and the buyer must take delivery of the asset.
2. The buyer of an option can choose to take delivery(a call) or make
   delivery(a put).


The *exercise price*, or *strike price* is the price at which the
underlying will be delivered should the holder of an option choose to
exercise his right to buy or sell.

*expiration date*: The date after which the option may no longer be
exercised is the expiration date.
