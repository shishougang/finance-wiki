#+TITLE: Option Volatility & Pricing, Advanced Trading Strategies and Techniques

* The language of options
** Contract specifications
Two *types*:
1. Call option: the right to buy or take a long position in a given
   asset at a fixed price on or before a specified data.
2. Put option: the right to sell or take a short position in a given
   asset.

The *difference* between an option and a futures contract:
1. A futures contract requires delivery at a fixed price. The seller
   must make delivery and the buyer must take delivery of the asset.
2. The buyer of an option can choose to take delivery(a call) or make
   delivery(a put).


The *exercise price*, or *strike price* is the price at which the
underlying will be delivered should the holder of an option choose to
exercise his right to buy or sell.

*expiration date*: The date after which the option may no longer be
exercised is the expiration date.

The premium paid for an option can be separated into two components,
the *intrinsic value* and the *time value*.

The additional amount ofpremium beyond the intrinsic value which
traders are willing to pay for an option is the time value, sometimes
also referred to as the option's time premium or extrinsic value.  

An option's premium is always composed of precisely its intrinsic
value and its time value. If a $400 gold call is trading at $50 with gold
at $435 per ounce, the time value of the call must be $15 , since the
intrinsic value is $35. The two components must add up to the option's
total premium of $50. 

If the option has no time value,its price will consist solely of
intrinsic value. The option is trading at *parity*.

Any option which has a positive intrinsic value is said to be
*in-the-money* by the amount of the intrinsic value. An option which
has no intrinsic value is said to be *out-of-the-money*.

An option whose exercise price is identical to the current price of
the underlying contract is said to be *at-the-money*, such an option
is also out-of-the-money since it has no intrinsic value.

The distinction between an at-the-money and out-of-the-money option 
because an at-the-money option has the greatest amount of time premium
and is usually traded very actively.

** MARGIN REQUIREMENTS
When a trader makes an opening trade on an exchange, the exchange may
require the trader to deposit some amount of *margin*, or good faith
capital.

** CONSTRUCT AN EXPlRATION GRAPH
1. If the graph bends, it wìll do so at an exercise price. Therefore,
   we can calculate the proflt or 10ss at each exercise price involved
   and simply connect these points with straight lines.
2. If the position is 10ng and short equa1 numbers of cal1s (puts),
   the potential downside (upside) risk or reward wi11be equal ωthe
   total debit or credit required to establish the position.
3. Ab ove highest exercise price all calls will go into-the-money, so
   the entire position will act like an underlying position which is
   either long or short underlying contracts equal to the number of
   net long or short calls. Below the lowest exercise price all puts
   will go into-the-money, so the entire position will act like an
   underlying position which is either long or short underlying
   contracts equal to the number of net long or short puts.

* Introduction to Theoretical Pricing Models
If he purchases options, not only must he be right about market
direction, he must also be right about *market speed*. 

The minimum factors you must consider:
1. The price of the underlying contract.
2. The exercise price.
3. The amount of time remaining to expiration.
4. The direction in which he expects the underlying market move.
5. The speed at which he expects the underlying market to move.

** THEORETICAL VALUE 
The two most common considerations in a financial investment are the
expected return and carrying costs. And, in fact, dividends are an
additional consideration in evaluating options on stock.

The goal of option evaluation is to determine, through the use of
theoretical pricing models, the theoretical value of an option. The
trader can then make an intelligent decision whether the option is
overpriced or underpriced in the marketplace, and whether the
theoretical edage is sufficient to justify going into the marketplace
and making a trade.

** A SIMPLE APPROACH
We can now summarize the necessary steps in developing a model: 
1.  Propose a series of possible prices at expiration for the
    underlying contract.
2.  Assign an appropriate probability to each possible price.
3.  Maintain an arbitrage-free underlying market.
4.  From the prices and probabi1ities in steps 1, 2, and 3, calculate
    the expected  return for the option.
5.  From the option's expected return, deduct the carrying cost.

In its original form, the Black-Scholes Model was intended to evaluate
European options (no early exercise permitted) on non-dividend paying
stocks. Shortly after its introduction, realizing that rnost stocks do
pay dividends, Black and Scholes added a dividend cornponent. In 1976,
Fischer Black rnade slight rnodifications to the rnodel to allow for
the evaluation of options on futures contracts. And in 1983, Mark
Garman and Steven Kohlhagen made several other modifications to allow
for the evaluation of options on foreign currencies. The futures
version and the foreign currencyversion are known officially as the
Black Model and the Garman-Kohlhagen Model, respectively. But the
evaluation rnethod in each version, whether the original Black-Scholes
Model for stock options, the Black Model for futures options, or the
Garman-Kohlhagen Model for foreign currency options, is so similar
that they have all come to be known as simply the Black-Scholes Model.
The various forrns of the model differ primarily in how they calculate
the forward price of由eunderlying contract, and an option trader will
simply choose the form appropriate to the underlying instrument.

In order to calculate an option's theoretical value using the
Black-Scholes Model, we need to know at a minimum five characteristics
of the option and its underlying contract. There are:

1. The option's exercise price.
2. The amount of time remaining to expiration.
3. The current price of the underlying contract.
4. The risk-free interest rate over the life of the option.
5. The volatility of the underlying contract.

Black and Scholes also incorporated into their model the concept of
the *riskless hedge*. To take advantage of a theoretically mispriced
option，it is necessary to establish a hedge by offsetting the option
position with this theoretically equivalent underlying position. That
is, whatever option position we take, we must take an opposing market
position in the underlying contract. The correct proportion of
underlying contracts needed to establish this riskless hedge is known
as the *hedge ratlo*.

* Volatility
** RANDOM WALKS AND NORMAL DISTRIBUTIONS
Thís leads to an important distínction between evaluation of an
underlying contract and evaluation of an option. If we assume at
prices are distributed along a normal distribution curve, the value of
an underlying contract depends on where the peak of the curve is
located, while the value of an option depends on how fast le curve
spreads out.

** LOGNORMAL DISTRIBUTIONS
A continuously compounded rate of return of +12% yields a profit of
$127.50 after one year,while a continuously compounded rate of return
of -12% yields a loss of only $113.08.

When price changes are assumed to be normally distributed, the
continuous compounding of these price changes wiU cause the prices at
maturity to be *lognormally distributed*. 

The Black-Scholes Model is a contínuous time model. It assumes at the
volatility of an underlying instrument is constant over the life of
the option, but that this volatility is continuously compounded. These two
assumptions mean that the possible prices of the underlying instrument
at expiration ofthe option are lognormally distributed. 

It also explains why options with higher exercise prices caηy more
value than options with lower exercise prices,where both exercise prices
appear to be an identical amount away from the price of the underlying
instrument. 

Summarize the most irnportant assurnptions governing price movement
int the Black-Scholes Model:

1. Changes in the price of an underlying instrurnent are randorn and
   cannot be artificially manipulated, nor is it possible to predict
   beforehand direction in which prices will move.
2. The percent changes in the price of an underlying instrurnent are
   norrnally distributed.
3. Because the percent changes in the price of the underlying
   instrurnent are assumed to be continuously cornpounded, the prices
   of the underlying instrument at expiration will be lognormally
   distributed.
4. The mean of the lognormal distribution will be located at the
   forward price of the underlying contract.

** TYPES OF VOLATILITIES
+ Future Volatility: Future volatility is what every trader would like
  to know, the volatility at best describes the future distribution of
  prices for an underlying contract.
+ Historical Volatility
+ Forecast Volatility
+ Implied Volatility: It is volatility being implied to the
  underlying contract through the pricing of the option in the
  marketplace. Even though the term premium real1y refers to an
  option's price, it is common among traders to refer to the implied
  volati1ity as the premium or premium level. If the current implied
  volatility is high by historical standards, or high relative to the
  recent historical volatility of the underlying contract, a trader
  might say that premium levels are high; if implied volatility is
  unusuallylow,he might say that premium levels are low.  
  
  He might
  then look at the difference between each option's theoretical value
  and its price in marke lace selling any options which were
  overpriced relative to the theoretical value, and buying any options
  which were underpriced. 
+ Seasonal Volatility: 
* Using an Option's Theoretical Value
The purchase or sale of a theoretically mispriced option requires us
to  establish a hedge by taking an opposing positlon in the
underlying contract. When this is done correctly, for small changes
in the price of the underlying, the increase (decrease) in the value
of the optlon position will exactly offset the decrease  (increase) in
the value of the opposing position in the underlying contract. Such a
hedge is unbiased, or *neutral*, as to the direction of the underlying
contract.

The number which enables us to establish a neutral hedge under current
market  conditions is a by-product of theoretical pricing model and is
known as the *hedge ratio* or, more commonly, the *delta*. 

1. The delta of a call option is always somewhere between 0 and 1.00. 
2. The delta of an option can change as market conditions change. 
3. An underlying contract always has a delta of 1.00. 

The steps we have thus far taken illustrate the correct procedure in
using an option theoretical value:
1. Purchase (sell) undervalued (overvalued) options.
2. Establish a delta neutraI hedge against the underlying contract.
3. Adjust the hedge at regular intervals to remain delta neutral.

At that time we plan to close out the position by:
1. Letting any out-of-the-money options expire worthless.
2. Selling any in-the-money options at parity (intrinsic value) or,
   equiva1ently, exercising them and offsetting them against the
   underlying futures contract.
3. Liquidating any outstanding futures contracts at the market price.


1n a frictionless market we assume that: 
1.  Traders can freely buy or sell the underlying contract without
    restriction 
2.  AlI traders can borrow and lend money at the same rate. 
3.  Transaction costs are zero. 
4.  There are no tax considerations. 
* Option Values and Changing Market Conditions 
** THE DELTA
three interpretations of delta:
+ the hedge ratio
+ Rate of Change in the theoretical value: The de1ta is a measure of how an optio 's value
  changes with respect to a change in the price of the underlying
  contract.
+ Theoretical or Equivalent Underlying Position 
** THE GAMMA
The gamma sometimes referred to as the curvature of an option,
is the rate at which an option's delta changes as the price of the
underlying changes. 

If an option has a gamrna of 5for each point rise (fal1) in the price
of the und.erlying,the option will gain (lose) 5 de1tas.

Every option trader learns to look carefully not only at current
directional risk (the delta), but also at how that directional risk
will change if the underlying market begins ωmove (the gamma).
** THE THETA
The *theta(θ)* ，or tíme decay factor,is the rate at which an
option loses value as time passes.
** THE VEGA OR KAPPA
The *vega* of an option is usually given in point change ín theoretical
value for each one percentage point change in volatility.

Since vega is not a Greek letter, a common alternative in academic
literature, where Greek letters are preferred, is kappa (K).
** THE RHO
The sensitivity of an optio 's theoretical value to a change in
interest rates is given by its rho (P).
** SUMMARY
+ Delta: Deltas range from zero for far out-of.the-money calls to 100
  for deeply in-the-money calls, and from zero for far
  out-of-the-money puts to -100 for deeply in-the-money puts.

  At-the-money calls have deltas of approximately 50, and at-the-money
  puts approximately -50.

  As time passes,or as we decrease our volatility assumption,call
  deltas move away om 50,and puts deltas away from -50. As we increase
  our volatility assumption, cal1 deltas move towards 50, and put
  deltas towards -50.
+ Gamma: At-the-money options have greater gammas than either in- or
  out-of-the-money options with otherwise identical contract
  specifications.

  As we increase our volati1ity assumptíon, the gamma of an in~ or
  out-of~the~money option rises, while gamma of an at le~money option
  falls. As we decrease our volatility assumption, or as time to
  expiration grows shorter, the gamma of an in~ or out-of~the money
  option falls, while the gamma of an at~the-money option rises,
  sometimes dramatically.
+ Theta: At-the~money options have greater etas than either in~ or
  out~ofthe-money options with otherwise identical contract
  specifications.

  The theta of an at-the-money option increases as expiration
  approaches. A short-term, at-the-money option will a1 ways decay
  more quickly than a long-term, at-the-money option.
  
  As we increase (decrease) our volatility assumption, the theta of an
  option will rise (fall). Higher volatility means there is greater
  time value associated with the option, so at each day's decay wil1
  also be greater when no movement occurs.
+ Vega: At-the-money options have greater vegas than either in- or
  out-ofthe-money options With otherwise identical contract
  specifications.
  
  Out-of-the-money options have the greatest vega as apercent of
  theoretical value.

The various positions and their respective signs are given in Figure
6-26. The sign of the delta， gamma, theta, or vega, toge er with the
magnitude of the numbers, tel1 the trader which changes in market
conditions will either help or hurt his position, and to what degree.
The positive or negative effect of changing market conditions is
summarized in Figure 6-27.


[[./files/option-variable.jpg]]

An option's *elasticity*, sometimes denoted with the Greek letter
omega(or less commonly the Greek letter lambda), is the relative
percent change in an option's value for a given percent change in the
price of the underlying contract.

The elasticity is sometimes referred to as the option's *leverage
value*. The greater an option's elasticity, the more highly leverage
the option.

An easy method of calculating:

elasticity = (underlying price) / (theoretical value) * delta

* Introduction to Spreading
Spreading is simply a way of enabling an optlon trader to take
advantage of theoretlcally mispriced options, while at the same time
reducing the effects of short-term changes in market conditions so
that he can safely hold an optlon positlon to maturity.

** WHY SPREAD?
At some point the intelligent trader will have to consider not only
the potential profit, but also the risk  associated with a strategy.

No trader will survive very long if his livelihood depends on
estimating each input with 100% accuracy. Even when he incorrectly
estimates the inputs, the experienced trader can survive if he has
constructed intelligent spread strategies which allow for a wide
margin of error.

* Volatility Spreads
Regardless ofwhich method we choose, each spread will  have certain
features in common: 

+ Eachspread will be approximately delta neutral. 
+ Each spread will be sensitive to  changes in  the  price of the
  underlying instrument.
+ Each spread will be sensitive to changes in implied volatility.
+ Each spread wil1  be sensitive to the passage of time.

** BACKSPREAD
A backspread is a delta neutral spread which consists of more long
(purchased) options than short (sold) options where all options expire
at the same time. 

A call backspread consists of long calls at a higher exercise price
and short calls at a lower exercise price. A put backspread consists
of long puts at a lower exercise price and short puts at a higher
exercise price. 


If no movement occurs, a backspread is likely to be a losing strategy. 

[[./files/call-backspread.jpeg]]

[[./files/put-backspread.jpeg]]

A trader will tend ωchoose the type ofbackspread which reflects his
opinion about market direction. If he foresees a market with great
upside potential, he will tend to choose a call backspread; if he
foresees a market with great downside potential he will tend to choose
a put backspread. He will avoid backspreads in quiet markets since the
underlying contract is unlikely to move very far in either direction. 

** RATIO VERTICAL SPREAD
A trader who takes the opposite side of a backspread also has a delta
neutral spread, but he is short more contracts than long, with all
options expiring at the same time. Such a spread is sometimes referred
to as a ratio spread or a vertical spread.

Designate the opposite of a backspread as a ratio vertical spread.

[[./files/call-ratio-vertical-spread.jpeg]]

[[./files/put-ratio-vertical-spread.jpeg]]

** STRADDLE
A straddle consists of either a long call and a long put, or a short
call and a short put, where both options have the same exercise price
and expire at the same time. 

If both the call and put are purchased, the trader is said to be long
the straddle; if both options are sold, the trader is said to be short
the straddle. 

[[./files/long-straddle.jpeg]]

[[./files/short-straddle.jpeg]]

** STRANGLE
Like a straddle, a strangle consists of a long call and a long put, or
a short call and a short put, where both options expire at the same
time. In a strangle, however， the options have different exercise
prices. If both options are purchased, the trader is long the
strangle if both options are sold, the trader is short the strangle.

[[./files/long-strangle.jpeg]]

[[./files/short-strangle.jpeg]]

To avoid confusion a strangle is commonly assumed to consist of
out-the-money options. If the underlying market is current1y at 100
and a trader wants to purchase the June 95/105 strangle, it is assumed
that he wants to purchase a June 95 put and a June 105 call. When both
options are in-the-money, the position is sometimes referred to as a
*guts*.

** BUTTERFLY
A butterfly consists of options at three equally spaced exercise
prices, where all options are of the same type (either all calls or
all puts) and expire at the same time.

In a long butterfly the outside exercise prices are purchased and the
insíde exercise price is s01d, and vice versa for a short butterfly.

It is always 1 x 2 x 1, with two of each inside exercise price traded
for each one of the outside exercíse prices. If the ratio is other
than 1 x 2 x 1, the spread is no longer a butterfly. 

[[./files/long-butterfly.jpeg]]

[[./files/short-butterfly.jpeg]]

a long butterfly tends to act like a ratio vertica1 spread and a short
butterfly tends to act like a backspread.
** TIME SPREAD (calendar spread or horizontal spread)
Time spreads, sometimes referred to as calendar spreads or horizontal
spreads, consist of opposing positions whlch expire in different
months. The most common type of time spread consists o

The most common type of time spread consists of opposing positions in
two options of the same type  (either both calls or both puts) where
both options have the same exercise price. When the long-term option
is purchased and the short-term option is sold, a trader is long the
time spread; when the short-term option is purchased and the long-term
option is sold, the trader is short the time spread. 



[[./files/long-time-spread.jpeg]]

[[./files/short-time-spread.jpeg]]


 If we assume that the options making up a time spread are
 approxjmately at-the-money, time spreads have two important
 characteristics:

+ A long time spread always wants the underlying market sit still. 
  Since a short-term at-the-money option always decays more quickly
  than a longterm at-the-money option, regardless of whether the
  options are calls or puts, both a long call time spread and a long
  put time spread want the underlying market to sit sti1l. Ideally,
  both spreads would like the short-term option to expire right
  at-the-money so that the long-term option will retain as much time
  value as possible while the short-term option expires worthless. 

[[./files/effect-of-time-passage-time-spreads.jpeg]]

+ A long time spread always benefits jrom an increase in implied
  volatility.
  As time to expiration increases, the vega of an option increases.
  This means that a long-term option is always more sensitive in total
  points to a change in volatility than a short-term option with the
  same exercise price. 

[[./files/effect-of-volatility-time-spreads.jpeg]]


These two opposing forces, the decay in an option's value due to the
passage of time and the change in an option's value due to changes in
volatility, give time spreads their unique characteristics. When a
trader buys or sel1s a time spread, he is not only attempting to
forecast movement in the underlying market. He is剖sotrying to
forecast changes in imp1ied volatility.

** THE EFFECT OF CHANGING INTEREST RATES AND DIVIDENDS
If we are considering stock options with different expiration dates,we
mut consider two different forward prices. Andthese two forward prices
may not be equaly sensitive to a change in interest rates. 

If interest rates increase，the time spread will widen because the
June forward price will rise more quickly than the March forward
price. Therefore, a long (short) call time spread in the stock option
market must have a positive (negative) rho.

if interest rates increase, the put time spread will narrow.
Therefore, a long (short) put time spread in the stock option market
must have a negative (positive) rho.

An increase (decrease) in dividends lowers (raises) the forward price
of stock.

In a time spread, if a dividend payment is expected between expiration
of the short-term and long-term option, the long-term option will be
affected by the lowered forward price of the stock. Hence, an increase
in dividends, if at least one dividend payment is expected between the
expiration dates, will cause call time spreads to narrow and put time
spreads to widen. A decrease in dividends will have the opposite
effect, with call time spreads widening and put time spreads
narrowing. The effect of changing interest rates and dividends on
stock option time spreads is shown below:

[[./files/effects-interest-rates-dividends-time-spreads.jpg]]

** DIAGONAL SPREADS
A diagonal spread Is similar to a time spread, except that the options
have different exercise prices.

** OTHER VARIATIONS
*A Christmas tree* (also referred to as a ladd is a term which can be
applied to a variety of spreads. The spread usually consists of three
different exercise prices where all options are of the same type and
expire at the same time. In a long (short) call Christmas tree, one
call is purchased (sold) at the lowest exercise price,and one call is
sold (purchased) at each of the higher exercise prices. In a long
(short) put Christmas tree, one put is purchased (sold) at the highest
exercise price, and one put is sold (purchased) at each of the lower
exercise prices.


Long Christmas trees , when done delta neutral， can be thought of as
particular types of ratio vertical spreads. Such spreads therefore
increase in value if the underlying market either sits still or moves
very slowly. Short Christmas trees can be thought of as particular
types of backspreads, and therefore increase in value with big moves
in the underlying market.

[[./files/christmas-trees.jpg]]


It is possible to construct a spread which has the same
characteristics as a butterfly by purchasing a straddle (strangle)
and selling a strangle (straddle) where the straddle is executed at
an exercise price midway between the strangle's exercise prices. All
options must expire at the same time. Because the position wants the
same outcome as a butterfly, it is known as an *iron butterfly*.

[[./files/iron-butterffiles.jpg]]

Another variation on a butterfly, known as a *condor*, can be constructed
by splitting the inside exercise prices. Now the position consists of
four options at consecutive exercise prices where the two outside
options are purchased and the two inside options sold (a long condor),
or the two inside options are purchased and the two outside options
sold (a short condor). As with a butterfly, all options must be of the
same type(all calls or all puts) and expire at the same time.

** SPREAD SENSITIVITIES

[[./files/category-gamma-vega.jpg]]

[[./files/charact-volatility-spreads.jpg]]

** CHOOSING AN APPROPRlATE STRATEGY
With so many spreads avai1 able, how do we know which type of spread
is best? 

Ideally, we would like ωconstruct a spread by purchasing options
which are underpriced and se1li ng options which are overpriced. 

If options general/y appear underprtced (low implied volatility),
look for spreads with a positive vega. This includes strategies in
backspread or long time spread category. !f options generally appear
overpriced (high implied volatility)，look for spreads wtth a negative
vega. This includes strategies in the ratio vertical or short time
spread category.

Long time spreads are likely to be profitable when implied
volatility is low but is expected to rise; short time spreads are
likely to be profttable when implied volatility is high but is
expected to fail.
** ADJUSTMENTS
The optimum use of a theoretical pricing model requires a trader to
continuously maintain a delta neutral position throughout the life of
the spread.

1. Adjust at regular intervals -- In theory, the adjustment process is
   assumed to be continuous because volatility is assumed to be a
   continuous measure of the speed of the market.
2. Adjust when the positlon becomes a predetermlned number 01 deltas
   or short.
3. Adjust by feel.

** ENTERING A SPREAD ORDER
The following contingency orders, all ofwhich are defined in Appendix
A, are often used in option markets: 

#+begin_verse
All  Or None 
Fill Or Kill 
Immediate Or Cancel 
Market If Touched

* Risk Considerations
** CHOOSING THE BEST SPREAD
We can summarize these risks as follows: 
+ Delta (DirectionaI) Risk-The risk that the underlying market will
  move in one direction rather than another. When we create a position
  which is delta neutral, we are trying to ensure that initially the
  position has no particular preference as to the direction in which
  the underlying instrument will move. A delta neutral position does
  not necessarily eliminate all directional risk, but it usually
  leaves us immune to directional risks within a limited range.
+ Gamma (Curvature) Risk -The risk of a large move in the underlying
  contract, regardless of direction. The gamma position is a measure
  of how sensitive a position is to such large moves. A positive
  gamma position does not really have gamma risk since such a position
  will, in theory, increase in value with movement in the underlying
  contract. A negative gamma position, however, can quickly lose its
  theoretical edge with a large move in the underlying contract. The
  consequences of such a move must always be a consideration when
  analyzing the relative merits of different positions.
+ Theta (Time Decay) Risk一Therisk that time will pass with no
  movement in the underlying contract.  This is the opposite side of
  gamma risk. Positions with positive gamma become more valuable With
  large moves in the underlying. But if movement helps, the passage of
  time hurts. A positive gamma always goes hand in hand with a
  negative theta. A trader with a negative theta will always have to
  consider the risk in terms of how much time can pass before the
  spread's theoretical edge disappears. The position wants movement,
  but if the movement fails to occur within the next day, or next
  week, or next month, will be spread, in theory, still be profitable?
+ Vega (Volatility) Risk --- The risk that the volatility which we
  input into the theoretical pricing model will be incorrect. If we
  input an incorrect volatility, we will be assuming an incorrect
  distribution of underlying prices over time. Since some positions
  have a positive vega and are hurt by declining volatility, and some
  positions have a negative vega and are hurt by rising volatility,
  the vega represents a risk to every position. A trader must always
  consider how much the volatility can move againsthim before
  thepotential profit from a position disappears.
+ Rho (Interest Rate) Risk-The risk that interest rates will change
  over the life of the option. A position with a positive rho will be
  helped (hurt) by an increase (decline) in interest rates, while a
  position with a negative rho wil1 show just the opposite
  characteristics. Generally, the interest rate is the least
  important of the inputs into a theoretical pricing model, and it is
  unlikely, except for special situations, that a trader will give
  extensive thought to rho risk associated with a position.

** PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
While there is no substitute for experience, most traders quickly
learn an important rule: straddles and strangles are the riskiest of 
all spreads.

** HOW MUCH MARGIN FOR ERROR?
Perhaps a better way to approach the question is to ask not what is a
reasonable margin for error, but rather to ask what is the correct
size in which to do a spread given a known margin for error.

** DIVIDENDS AND INTEREST
** WHAT IS A GOOD SPREAD? 
It is impossible ωtake into consideration everypossible risk. A
spread which passed every risk test would probably have so little
theoretical edge that it wouldn't be worth doing. But the trader who
allows himself a reasonable margin for error will find that even his
losses will not lead to financial ruin. A good spread is not
necessarily the one that shows the greatest proflt when things go
well; it may be the one which shows the least loss when things go
badly. Winning trades always take care of themselves. Losing trades,
which don't glve back al1 the profits from the winning ones, are just
as important.
** ADJUSTMENTS
An adjustment to trader's delta position may reduce his directional
risk, but if he simultaneously increases his gamma, theta, or vega
risk, he may inadvertently be exchanging one type of risk for another. 

+ A delta adjustment made with the underlying contract is essentially a
  risk neutral adjustment.
+ An adjustment made with options may reduce the delta risk, but will
  also change the other nsk characteristfcs assocíated wtth the
  position.

A disciplined trader knows that sometimes, because of risk
considerations, the best course ls to reduce the size of the spread,
even if it means gi.ving up some theoretical edge. This may be hard on
the trader's ego, particular1y 1f he must personally go back into the
market and either buy back options which he originally sold at a lower
price, or sell out options whîch he originally purchased at a higher
price. However, if a trader is unwilling to swallow his pride from
time to time, and admit that he made a mistake, his trading career is
certain to be a short one. 

If a trader finds that any de1ta adjustment in the option market that
reduces his risk will also reduce his theoretical edge，and he is
unwil1ing to give up any theoretical edge, his only recourse is to
make h1s adjustments in the underlying market. An underlying contract
has no gamma, theta, or vega, so the risks of the position will remain
essentially the same.

** A QUESTION OF STYLE
In practice, however, many option traders begin theîr trading careers
by taking positions in the underlying market, where direction is the
primary consideration. Many traders therefore deve10p a style of
trading based on presumed directional moves in the underlying market.
A trader might，for examp1e, be a trend follower, adhering to the
philosophy that "the trend is your friend." Or he might be a
contrarian. preferring to "buy weakness, sell strength." 
** LIQUIDITY
An important consideration in deciding whether to enter into a trade
is often the ease with which the trader can reverse the trade. Liquid
option markets, where there are many buyers and sellers, are much less
risky than illiquid markets, where there are few buyers and sellers.
In the same way, a spread which consists of very liquid options is
much less risky出ana spread which consists of one or more illiquid
options.

* Bull and Bear Spreads
** NAKED POSITIONS 
If all options are overpríced (high implied volatility), we might
sell puts to create a bullish position, or sel1 calls to create a
bearish position. If al1  options are underpriced (low implied
volatility), we might buy calls ωcreate a bullish position, or 
buy puts to create a bearish position. 

The problem with this approach is that，as with all non-hedged
positions, there is very llttle margin error.

** BULL AND BEAR RATIO SPREADS
If a trader believes that implied volatility is too hlgh, one sensible
strategy is a ratio vertical spread.

Even though the trader was correct ín his bullish sentiment, the
position was primarily a volatility spread, so that the volatility
characteristics of the position eventually outweighed any
considerations of market direction.

Since this spread is a volatility spread, the primary consideration,
as before, is the volatility of the market. Only secondarily are
we concerned with the direction of movement. If the trader
overestimates volatility, and the market moves more slowly than
expected, the spread which was initially de1ta positive can instead
become delta negative.

** BULL AND BEAR BUTTERFLIES AND TlME SPREADS
If the  underlying market is currently at 100, he might choose to buy
the June 105/110/115 call butterfly. Since this position wants the
underlying market at 110 at expiration, and it is currently at 100,
the position is a bull butterfly. This will be reflected in the
position having a positive delta.  

Unfortunately, if the underlying market moves too swift1y, say to 120,
the butterfly can invert from a positive to a negative delta position.

Conversely, if the trader is bearish, he can always choose to buy a
butterfly where the inside exercise price is below the current price
of the underlying market. But again, if the market moves down too
quickly and goes through the inside exercise price, the position will
invert from a negative to a positive delta.

In a simi1ar manner, a trader can choose time spreads 由atare either
bul1ish or bearish. A long time spread always wants the near-term
contract to  expire exactly at-the-money. A long time spread will be
initial1y bullish if the exercise price of the time spread is above
the current price of the underly1ng market.

** VERTICAL SPREADS 
Vertical spreads are not on1y initially bullish or bearish, but
they remain bullish or bearish no matter how market conditions change. A
vertical spread always consists of one long (purchased) option and one
short (sold) option, where both options are of the same type (either
both calls or both puts) and expire at the same time. The options are
distinguished only by their different exercise prices. Typical vertical
spreads might be:

#+begin_verse
buy 1 June 100 call 
sell 1 June 105 cal1 
or 
buy 1 March 105 put 
sell 1 March 95 put
#+end_verse

If a trader wants to do a vertical spread, he has essentially four
choices. If he is bullish he can choose a bull vertical call spread or
a bull vertical put spread; if he is bearish he can choose a bear
vertical call spread or a bear vertical put spread. For example: 

#+begin_verse
bull call spread: buy a June 100 call 
                  sell  a June 105 call 
bull put spread:  buy a June 100 put 
                  sell a June 105 put 
bear call spread: sell a June 100 call 
                  buy a June 105 call 
bear put spread:  sell a June 100 put 
                  buy a June 105 put
#+end_verse

Two factors determine the total directional characteristlcs of a
vertlcal spread: 
1. The delta of the specific vertical spread 
2. The size in which the spread is executed

The greater the distance between exercise prices, the greater the
delta value associated with the spread. A 95/110 bull spread wil1 be
more bullish than a 100/110 bull spread, which will, ín turn, be more
bullish than a 100/105 bull spread. 

[[./files/vertical-spread-compare.jpeg]]


Once a trader decides on an expiratlon month in which to  take his
directlonal position, he must decide which specific spread is best.
That is, he must decide which exercise prices to use. A common
approach is focus on the at-the-money optlons. If a trader does this,
he will have the fol1owing choices:

[[./files/at-the-money-vertical-spread.jpeg]]

The reason becomes clear if we recall one of the characteristics of
option evaluation introduced in Chapter 6: If we consider three
options, an in-the-money， at-the-money， and out-of-the-money option
which are identical except for their exercise prices, the at-the-money
option is always the most sensitive in total points to a change in
volatility. 

This characteristic leads to a very simple rule for choosing bull and
bear vertical spreads:

#+begin_quote
If implied volatility is too low, vertical spreads should focus on purchasing
the at-the-money optlon. If implied volatility is too high, vertical spreads
should focus on selling the at-the-money options.
#+end_quote

A trader is not required to execute any vertical spread by first
buying or selling the at-the-money option. Such spreads always involve
two options, and a trader can choose to either execute the complete
spread in one transaction, or leg into the spread by trading one
option at a time. Regardless of how the spread is executed, the trader
should focus on the at-the-money option, either buying it when implied
volatility is too low, or selling it when implied volatility is too
high.

The choice of the at-the-money option is slightly different when we
move to stock options. If we define the at-the-money option as the one
whose de1ta is closest to 50, then we may find at the at-the-money
option is not always the one whose exercise price is closest current
price of the underlying contract. This ís because the option with a
delta closest 50 will be the one whose exercise price ís closest
to forward price of underlying contract. In stock options, the forward
price is the current price of stock, plus carrying costs on the
stock, less expected dividends. 

Why míght a trader with a directional opinion prefer a vertical
spread to an outright long or short posítíon in the underlying
instrument? For one thing, a vertical spread is much less risky than
an outright posítion. Atrader who wants to take a position which is
500 deltas long can either buy fíve underlying contracts or buy 25
vertical calI spreads with a delta of 20 each. The 25 vertical spreads
may sound riskier than five underlying contracts, until we remember
at a vertical spread has limited risk whíle the position in
underlying has open-ended risk. Of course,greater risk also means
greater reward. A trader with a long or short position in the
underlyíng market can reap huge rewards if the market makes a large
move in his favor. By contrast,the vertical spreader's profits are
limited,but he will also be much less bloodied if the market makes an
unexpected move in the wrong direction.

* Option Arbitrage
** SYNTHETIC POSITIONS
+ synthetic long underlying = long call + short put
+ synthetic short underlying = short call + long put 
where all options expire at the same time and have the same exercise
price.

Rearranging the components of a synthetic underling position, we can
create four other synthetic relationships: 
+ synthetic long call = long an underlylng contract + long put 
+ synthetic short call = short an underlying contract + short put 
+ synthetic long put = short an underlying contract + long call 
+ synthetic short put = long an underlying contract + short call 

The difference between the call and put price ís often referred to as
the synthettc market. In the absence of any interest or dividend
considerations, the value of the synthetic market can be expressed as: 

call price -put price = underlying price - exercise price 

If this equality holds, there ís no difference between taking a
position in the underlying market, or taking an equivalent synthetic
position in the option market.

The three-sided relationship between a call, a put, and its underlying
contract means that we can always express the value of any one of these
contracts in terms of the other two: 

+ underlying price = call prîce - put prîce + exercíse price 
+ call prîce = underlying price + put príce - exercíse price 
+ put price = call prîce - underlying prîce + exercise price 

This three-sided relationship is sometimes referred *put-call parity*. 
** CONVERSIONS AND REVERSALS
When a trader identifies two contracts which are essentially the same
but which are trading at different prices, the natural course ís to
execute an arbitrage by purchasing the cheaper contract and selling the
more expensive. 

No matter what happens in the underlying market, the underlying
position will do exactly .25 better than the synthetìc position. The
entire position wíll therefore show a profit of .25, regardless of
movement in the underlying market. 

The foregoing position, where the purchase of an underlying contract
is offset by  the sale of a synthetic position, is known as a
*conversion*. The opposíte position, where the sale of an underlying
contract is offset by the purchase of a synthetic position, is known
as a *reverse conversion* or, more commonly, a *reversal*. 

Summarizing: 

#+begin_quote
conversion  =  long underlying + synthetlc short underlying 
            =  long underlying + short call + long put 
reversal    =  short underlying + synthetic long underlying 
            =  short underlying + long call + short put 
#+end_quote
As before, we assume that the call and the put have the same exercise
price and expiration date.

Typically, an arbitrageur will attempt to simultaneously buy and sell
the same items in different markets to take advantage of price
discrepancies between the two markets.

Synthetic positions are often used to  execute conversions and
reversals, so traders sometimes refer to the synthetic market (the
difference between the call price and put price) as the
converston/reversal market. 

All experienced traders are familiar with the price relationship
between a synthetic position and its underlying contract, so that any
imbalance in the conversion/reversal market is 1ikely to be
short-lived. If the synthetic is overpriced, all traders will want to
execute a conversion (buy the underlying, sell the call, buy the put).
If the synthetic is underpriced, all traders will want to execute a
reversal (sell the underlying, buy the call, sell the put). Such
activity, where everyone is attempting to  do the same thing, will
quickly force  the synthetic market back to  equilibrium. Indeed,
imbalances in the conversion/reversal market are usually small and
rarely last for  more than a few seconds.

*** Futures Option Markets
If the cash flow resulting from an option trade and a trade in the
underlying instrument is identical, the synthetic relationship is
simply:

call price - put price = underlying price - exercise price 

This will be true if  interest rates are zero, or in  futures  markets
where both the underlying contract and options on that contract are
subject to futures-type settlement.

Assuming that all options are European (no early exercise permitted),
we can now express the synthetic relationship in futures markets where
the options are settle in cash as follows: 

cal1 price - put price = futures price - exercise price - carrying costs 

where the carrying costs are calculated on either the difference
between the futures price and the exercise price, or the difference
between the call price and put price, both of which will be
approximately the same.

*** Stock Option Markets
Taking into consideration the interest rate component, we can express
the synthetic relationship as: 

call price - put price = stock price - exercise price + carrying costs

where the carrying costs are calculated on the exercise price.

call price -put price = stock price - exercise price + carrying
costs - dividends 

where the carrying costs are calculated on the exercise price and the
dividends are those expected prior to expiration.

** ARBITRAGE RISK
*** Interest Rate Risk
*** Execution Risk 
Anytime a strategy is executed one leg at a time, there is always the
risk of an adverse change in prices before the strategy can be
completed.
*** Pin Risk
The practical solution is to avoid carrying conversions and reversals
to expiration when there is a real possibility of expiration right at
the exercise price.
*** Settlement Risk in the Futures Market
If al1 contracts are subject to futures-type settlement, any credit or
debit resulting from changes in the price of the underlying futures
contract wil1 be offset by an equal but opposite cash flow from
changes in prices of the option contracts.

*** Dividend Risk in the Stock Market
** BOXES
The risk arises because a synthetic position in options and an actual
position in the underlying contract can have different characteristics，
either in terms of settlement procedure, as in the futures option
market, or in terms of the dividend payout, as in the stock option
market. 

How might we eliminate this risk?

#+begin_quote
short a call 
long a put 
long an underlying contract 
#+end_quote

replace the long underlyingpositlon with a deeply in-the-money call
Now our position is: 
#+begin_quote
short a call 
long a put 
long a deeply in-the-money call 
#+end_quote

instead  of replacing the  underlying position with a deeply
in-the-money call, we can sell a deeply in-the-money put: 
#+begin_quote
short a cal1 
long a put 
short a deeply in-the-money put 
#+end_quote

This type of position, where the underlying instrument in a conversion
or reversal is replaced with a deeply in-the-money  option, is  known
as a *three-way*.

Suppose we also execute a reversal at 90: 
#+begin_quote
long a June 90 call 
short a June 90 put 
short an underlying contract 

short a June 100 call 
long a June 100 put 
long an underlying contract 
#+end_quote
The long and short underlying contracts cancel out, leaving: 
#+begin_quote
long a June 90 call 
short a June 90 put 

short a June 100 call 
long a June 100 put
#+end_quote

This position, known as a box, is similar to a conversion or reversal,
except that any risk associated with holding a position in  the
underlyíng contract has been eliminated because the underlying
position has been replaced with a synthetic underlying position at a
different exercise price.

Since a box eliminates the risk associated with carrying a position in
the underlying contract, boxes are even less risky than conversions
and reversals, which are themselves low-risk strategies. 

** JELLY ROLLS 
Another method of eliminating a position in the underlying contract is
to take a synthetic position in a different expiration month, rather
than at a different exercise price as with a box. 

For example, suppose we have executed the following reversal:
#+begin_quote
long a June 100 call 
short a June 100 put 
short an underlying contract 

short a September 100 call 
long a September 100 put 
long an underlyíng contract
#+end_quote

If the underlyíng contract for bothJune and Septernber is identical,
theywil1 cancel out, leaving us with: 
#+begin_quote
long a June 100 cal1 
short a June 100 put 

short a September 100 cal1 
long a September 100 put
#+end_quote
These combined long and short synthetic positions taken at the same
exercise prices but in different expiration months is known as a jelly
roll or simplya roll.

The value of the roll is the cost of holding the stock for the
three-month period from June to September. 

#+begin_quote
jelly roll  = long-term synthetic - short-term synthetic 
            = (long-term call-long-term put) - (short-term call-short-term put) 
            = (long-term call-short-term call) - (long-term put - short-term put) 
            = caηying costs - expected dividends 
#+end_quote

** USING SYNTHETICS IN VOLATILITY SPREADS
the synthetic relationship: 

synthetic short cal1 = short put + short underlying

** TRADING WITHOUT THEORETICAL VALUES
Regardless of the  exact theoretical value, there ought to  be a
uniform progression of both individual option prices and spread prices
in the marketplace. If this uniform progression is violated, a
trader can take advantage of the situation by purchasing the option or
spread which is relatively cheap and selling the option or spread
which is relatively expensive. 

The trader can start with conversions and reversals, then look at
vertical spreads and butterflies, and finally consider straddles and
time spreads.

* Early Exercise of American Options
1. Given the opportunìty, under what cìrcumstances might a trader
   consìder exercising an American option prior to expiration? 

2. How much more should a trader be wi1ling to pay for an American
   option over an equivalent European option?

** FUTURES OPTIONS
option value = ìntrinsic value + volati1ìty value -interest rate
value

A trader who exercises a futures option early does so to capture the
interest on the option's intrinsic value. This intrinsic value will be
credited to his account only if the option is subject to stock-type
settlement.  

** STOCK OPTIONS
*** Early Exercise of Calls for the Dividends
call value = intrînsic value + interest rate value + volatility
value - dividend value

Since the only reason a trader would ever consider exercising a stock
option call early is to receive the dividend, if a stock pays no
dividend there is no reason to exercise a call early. If the stock
does paya dividend, the only time a trader ought to consider early
exercise is the day before the stock goes ex-dividend. At no other
time in its life is a stock option call an early exercise candidate. 

*** Early Exercise of Puts for Interest
put value = intrinsic value - interest rate value + volatility value +
dividend value

Whereas a stock option call can only be an early exercise candidate on
the day prior to the stock's ex-dividend date, a stock option put can
become an early exercise candidate anytime the interest which can
be earned through the sale of the stock at the exercise price is
sufficiently large.

*** Conditions for Early Exercise
infer two conditions which are necessary before a trader considers
exercising option early to capture is additional profit:

1. The option must be trading at parity.
2. The option must have a delta close to 100.

The importance of early exercise is greatest when the underlying
contract is a stock or physical commodity. In such a case there is a
significant difference between the carrying cost on an option and the
caπyi cost on underlying position. This difference will especially
affect the difference between European and Am erican put values, since
early exercise wil1 allow the trader to earn interest on the proceeds
from the sale at the exercise price. An option trader in either the
stock or physical commodity market will find that the additional
accuracy offered by an American model, such as the Cox-Ross-Rubenstein
or Whaley models,will indeed be worthwhile. 

** THE EFFECT OF EARLY EXERCISE ON TRADING STRATEGIES 
* Hedging with Options
** PROTECTIVE CALLS AND PUTS
The simplest wayωhedge an underlying position using optìons is to
purchase either a call to protect a short position, or a put to
protect a long position.

Since each strategy combines an underlying position with an option
position, it follows from Chapter 11 that the resulting protected
position is a synthetic option:

#+begin_quote
short underlying + long call = long put
long underlying + long put =  long call
#+end_quote

[[./files/protective-call.jpg]]

[[./files/protective-put.jpg]]

** COVERED WRITES
The value of typical covered writes,also known as overwrites, are
covered call and covered put. 

As with the purchase of a protective optlon, a covered write consists
of a position in the under ng and an option. It can therefore be
expressed as a synthetic position:

#+begin_quote
long underlying + short call = short put
short underlying + short put =short call
#+end_quote

[[./files/covered-call.jpg]]

[[./files/covered-put.jpg]]

** FENCES
A popular strategy, known as a fence, is to simultaneously combine the
purchase of a protective option with the sale ofa covered option. For
example, with an underlying contract at 50, a hedger with a long
position might choose to simultaneously sell a 55 call and purchase a
45 put. 

Fences are popular hedging tools because they offer known protection
at alow cost, or even a credit. At the same time ，they still allow a
hedger to participate, at least partially, in favorable market
movement. Fences go by a variety of names: range forwards, tunnels,
cylinders; among floor traders they are sometimes known as split
price conversions and reversals.

[[./files/long-fence.jpg]]

[[./files/short-fence.jpg]]

** COMPLEX HEDGING STRATEGIES
As a first step in choosing a strategy, a hedger might consider the
following:

1. Does the hedge need to offer protection against a I'worst case"
   scenario?
2. How much of the current directional risk should the hedge
   eliminate?
3. What additional risks is the hedger willing to accept?

ll otnel ctors being equal, in a high implied volatility market a hedger
should buy as few options as possible and sell as many options as
possible. Conversely, in a low implied volatility market a hedger
should buy as many options as possible and sell as few options as
possible.

A hedger who constructs a position with unlimited risk in either
direction is presumably taking a volatility position. There is nothing
wrong with this, since volatility trading can be highly profitable.
But a true hedger ought not lose sight of what his ultimate goal is:
to protect an existing position, and to keep the cost of this
protection as low as possible.

[[./files/summary-of-hedging-strategies.jpg]]

** PORTFOLIO INSURANCE
if he wants to replicate the combination of the underlying asset and
the 100 put, he must sell off 43% of his holdings in the asset. When
he does that, he will have a position theoretically equivalent to
owning a 100 call.

This process ofcontinuously rehedging an underlying position to
replicate an option position is often referred to as portfolio
insurance. 

If the mix of securities in a portfolio approximates an index, and
futures contracts are available on that index, the manager can
approximate the results of portfolio insurance by purchaslng or
selling futures contracts to increase or decrease the holdings in his
portfolio. 

Even if options are available on an underlying asset, a hedger may
still choose to effect a portfolio insurance strategy himself rather
then purchasing the option in the marketplace. For one thing, he may
consider the option too expensive. If he believes the option is
theoretically overpriced, in the long run it will be cheaper to
continuously rehedge the portfo1io. Or he may find insufficient
liquidity in the option market to absorb the number of option contracts
he needs to hedge his position. Finally, the expiration of options
which are available may not exactly correspond to the period over
which he wants to protect his position. If an option is available, but
expires earlier than desired, the hedger might still choose to
purchase options in marketplace, and then pursue a portfolio insurance
strategy over the period following the option's expiration. 

* Volatility Revisited
** SOME VOLATILITY CHARACTERISTICS
we might surmise at an underlying contract is likely to have a
typicallong-term average,or mean volatility. Moreover,the volatility
of the underlying contract appears to be mean reverting. When
volatility rises above the mean, one can be fairly certain that it
will eventually fall back to its mean; when volatility fal1 s below
the mean, one can be fairly certain that it will eventual1y rise to
its mean. 

** VOLATILITY FORECASTING
In addition ωthe mean reverting characteristic, volatility also tends
to exhibit sen.al correlatton. The volatility over any given period is
likely ωdepend on, or correlate with, the volatility over the
previous period, assuming that both periods cover the same amount
of time. If the volatilityofa contract over the last fourweeks was 15%
, the volatility over the next four weeks is more likely to be close
to 15% an far away from 15%. 

** A PRACTICAL APPROACH
Rather than asking what the correct volati1ity is, a trader might
instead aSk, given the current volatiUty climate, what' right
strategy? Rather than trying to forecast an exact volatility,a trader
will try to pick a strategy that best fits the volatility conditions
in the marketplace. To do this, a trader will want to consider several
factors:

1. What is long.term mean volatility of underlying contract?
2. What has been the recent historical volatility in relation to em
   volatility?
3. What is trend in recent historical volatility?
4. Where îs imp1ied volatility and what is its trend?
5. Are we dealing wi options of shorter or longer duration?
6. How stable does the volati1ity tend to be?

** SOME THOUGHTS ON IMPLIED VOLATILITY
*** Implied versus Historical Volatility

Market participants are making the logical assumption that what has
happened in the past is a good indicator of what will happen in the
future. 

the fluctuations in implied volatility were usually less than the
fluctuations  in  historical volatility. When the historical
volatility declined, the implied volatility rarely dec1ined by an
equal amount. And when historical volatility increased, the implied
volatility rarely increased byan equal amount. Because volatility
tends to be mean reverting, when historical volati1ity is above its
mean there is a greater likelihood that it will dec1ine, and when
historical volatility is below its mean there is a greater likelihood
that it will increase. 

*** Implied versus Future Volatility
* Stock Index Futures and Options
professional arbitrageurs find at in spite of the highly liquid and
usually efficient index markets, pricing disparities occur often
enough to warrant close monitoring of these markets. When a disparity
does exist,a trader can execute an arbitrage by hedging the mispriced
index against either other stock indices or against a basket of
stocks. Such arbitrage strategies are commonly refeηed to as *index
arbitrage*.
** CALCULATING AN INDEX
There are several different methods of calculating stock index values,
but the most common methods entail weighting the stocks either by
price or by capitalization. 

** REPLICATING AN INDEX
the number of shares of each stock required to replicate an index

for a price weighted index: point value / index divisor

for a capitalization weighted index: outstanding shares x point value
/ index divisor

** STOCK INDEX FUTURES
The purchase of a futures contract offers one important advantage over
the purchase of the component stocks: no cash outlay ís required to
purchase a futures contract. Consequently, there is an interest rate
savings equal to the cost of borrowing sufficient cash to purchase all
the stocks in the index.

** INDEX ARBITRAGE
If the futures príce doesn't reflect the fair value, a trader can
execute a profitable arbitrage by purchasing the undervalued asset,
either the basket of stocks or the futures contract, and selling
overvalued asset.

This type of trading strategy, where one buys or sells a mispriced stock
index futures contract and takes an opposing position in the
underlying stocks, is one type of index arbitrage. Since computers can
often be programmed to calculate the fair value of a futures contract,
and to execute the arbitrage when the futures contract is mispriced,
such astrategy is also commonly referred to as program trading. A buy
prograrn consists of buying the stocks and selling the futures
contract,and a sell program consists of selling the stocks and buying
the futures contract.

** INDEX OPTIONS
There are real1y two types of stock index options, those where the
underlying is a stock index futures contract,and those where the
underlying is the index itself

*** Options on Stock Index Futures
Although the ultirnate decision about the underlying price is
trader's, in a stock index futures option rnarket a trader should be
very careful about using an underlying futures price different from
the quoted price. As we have already seen ，出 theoretical value of
astock index futures contract depends information which rnay ot be
readily available to the trader. If he 1s wrong about the price at
which the index is actually trading because the individual stock
prices do not reflect the true rnarket,his theoretical evaluation of
the futures contract wil1 be incorrect.

*** Options on a Cash Index
*** Evaluating a Cash Index Option
*** A Phantom  Variable
It may seem odd, but in fact it doesn't matter whether the index
opens the next morning at a higher price, lower price, or unchanged.
What matters is that the marketplace believes that the market will
change, and that all contracts are priced accordingly. In such a
case, the trader rnust exercise those options which, given the
perceived change in the underlying price,now have a value less than
parity,and replace them with other contracts which are not limited by
parity constraints.

*** Synthetic Relationships
Because it can be difficult to trade a complete and correctly
proportioned basket of stocks, and because there is the additional
risk of early exercise after an index arbitrage has been
executed, mispriced synthetic relationships are not as easy to exploit
ín index option markets as in other option markets.

*** Finding a Substitute for the Index
