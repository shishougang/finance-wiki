#+TITLE: Option Volatility & Pricing, Advanced Trading Strategies and Techniques

* The language of options
** Contract specifications
Two *types*:
1. Call option: the right to buy or take a long position in a given
   asset at a fixed price on or before a specified data.
2. Put option: the right to sell or take a short position in a given
   asset.

The *difference* between an option and a futures contract:
1. A futures contract requires delivery at a fixed price. The seller
   must make delivery and the buyer must take delivery of the asset.
2. The buyer of an option can choose to take delivery(a call) or make
   delivery(a put).


The *exercise price*, or *strike price* is the price at which the
underlying will be delivered should the holder of an option choose to
exercise his right to buy or sell.

*expiration date*: The date after which the option may no longer be
exercised is the expiration date.

The premium paid for an option can be separated into two components,
the *intrinsic value* and the *time value*.

The additional amount ofpremium beyond the intrinsic value which
traders are willing to pay for an option is the time value, sometimes
also referred to as the option's time premium or extrinsic value.  

An option's premium is always composed of precisely its intrinsic
value and its time value. If a $400 gold call is trading at $50 with gold
at $435 per ounce, the time value of the call must be $15 , since the
intrinsic value is $35. The two components must add up to the option's
total premium of $50. 

If the option has no time value,its price will consist solely of
intrinsic value. The option is trading at *parity*.

Any option which has a positive intrinsic value is said to be
*in-the-money* by the amount of the intrinsic value. An option which
has no intrinsic value is said to be *out-of-the-money*.

An option whose exercise price is identical to the current price of
the underlying contract is said to be *at-the-money*, such an option
is also out-of-the-money since it has no intrinsic value.

The distinction between an at-the-money and out-of-the-money option 
because an at-the-money option has the greatest amount of time premium
and is usually traded very actively.

** MARGIN REQUIREMENTS
When a trader makes an opening trade on an exchange, the exchange may
require the trader to deposit some amount of *margin*, or good faith
capital.

** CONSTRUCT AN EXPlRATION GRAPH
1. If the graph bends, it wìll do so at an exercise price. Therefore,
   we can calculate the proflt or 10ss at each exercise price involved
   and simply connect these points with straight lines.
2. If the position is 10ng and short equa1 numbers of cal1s (puts),
   the potential downside (upside) risk or reward wi11be equal ωthe
   total debit or credit required to establish the position.
3. Ab ove highest exercise price all calls will go into-the-money, so
   the entire position will act like an underlying position which is
   either long or short underlying contracts equal to the number of
   net long or short calls. Below the lowest exercise price all puts
   will go into-the-money, so the entire position will act like an
   underlying position which is either long or short underlying
   contracts equal to the number of net long or short puts.

* Introduction to Theoretical Pricing Models
If he purchases options, not only must he be right about market
direction, he must also be right about *market speed*. 

The minimum factors you must consider:
1. The price of the underlying contract.
2. The exercise price.
3. The amount of time remaining to expiration.
4. The direction in which he expects the underlying market move.
5. The speed at which he expects the underlying market to move.

** THEORETICAL VALUE 
The two most common considerations in a financial investment are the
expected return and carrying costs. And, in fact, dividends are an
additional consideration in evaluating options on stock.

The goal of option evaluation is to determine, through the use of
theoretical pricing models, the theoretical value of an option. The
trader can then make an intelligent decision whether the option is
overpriced or underpriced in the marketplace, and whether the
theoretical edage is sufficient to justify going into the marketplace
and making a trade.

** A SIMPLE APPROACH
We can now summarize the necessary steps in developing a model: 
1.  Propose a series of possible prices at expiration for the
    underlying contract.
2.  Assign an appropriate probability to each possible price.
3.  Maintain an arbitrage-free underlying market.
4.  From the prices and probabi1ities in steps 1, 2, and 3, calculate
    the expected  return for the option.
5.  From the option's expected return, deduct the carrying cost.

In its original form, the Black-Scholes Model was intended to evaluate
European options (no early exercise permitted) on non-dividend paying
stocks. Shortly after its introduction, realizing that rnost stocks do
pay dividends, Black and Scholes added a dividend cornponent. In 1976,
Fischer Black rnade slight rnodifications to the rnodel to allow for
the evaluation of options on futures contracts. And in 1983, Mark
Garman and Steven Kohlhagen made several other modifications to allow
for the evaluation of options on foreign currencies. The futures
version and the foreign currencyversion are known officially as the
Black Model and the Garman-Kohlhagen Model, respectively. But the
evaluation rnethod in each version, whether the original Black-Scholes
Model for stock options, the Black Model for futures options, or the
Garman-Kohlhagen Model for foreign currency options, is so similar
that they have all come to be known as simply the Black-Scholes Model.
The various forrns of the model differ primarily in how they calculate
the forward price of由eunderlying contract, and an option trader will
simply choose the form appropriate to the underlying instrument.

In order to calculate an option's theoretical value using the
Black-Scholes Model, we need to know at a minimum five characteristics
of the option and its underlying contract. There are:

1. The option's exercise price.
2. The amount of time remaining to expiration.
3. The current price of the underlying contract.
4. The risk-free interest rate over the life of the option.
5. The volatility of the underlying contract.

Black and Scholes also incorporated into their model the concept of
the *riskless hedge*. To take advantage of a theoretically mispriced
option，it is necessary to establish a hedge by offsetting the option
position with this theoretically equivalent underlying position. That
is, whatever option position we take, we must take an opposing market
position in the underlying contract. The correct proportion of
underlying contracts needed to establish this riskless hedge is known
as the *hedge ratlo*.

* Volatility
** RANDOM WALKS AND NORMAL DISTRIBUTIONS
Thís leads to an important distínction between evaluation of an
underlying contract and evaluation of an option. If we assume at
prices are distributed along a normal distribution curve, the value of
an underlying contract depends on where the peak of the curve is
located, while the value of an option depends on how fast le curve
spreads out.

** LOGNORMAL DISTRIBUTIONS
A continuously compounded rate of return of +12% yields a profit of
$127.50 after one year,while a continuously compounded rate of return
of -12% yields a loss of only $113.08.

When price changes are assumed to be normally distributed, the
continuous compounding of these price changes wiU cause the prices at
maturity to be *lognormally distributed*. 

The Black-Scholes Model is a contínuous time model. It assumes at the
volatility of an underlying instrument is constant over the life of
the option, but that this volatility is continuously compounded. These two
assumptions mean that the possible prices of the underlying instrument
at expiration ofthe option are lognormally distributed. 

It also explains why options with higher exercise prices caηy more
value than options with lower exercise prices,where both exercise prices
appear to be an identical amount away from the price of the underlying
instrument. 

Summarize the most irnportant assurnptions governing price movement
int the Black-Scholes Model:

1. Changes in the price of an underlying instrurnent are randorn and
   cannot be artificially manipulated, nor is it possible to predict
   beforehand direction in which prices will move.
2. The percent changes in the price of an underlying instrurnent are
   norrnally distributed.
3. Because the percent changes in the price of the underlying
   instrurnent are assumed to be continuously cornpounded, the prices
   of the underlying instrument at expiration will be lognormally
   distributed.
4. The mean of the lognormal distribution will be located at the
   forward price of the underlying contract.

** TYPES OF VOLATILITIES
+ Future Volatility: Future volatility is what every trader would like
  to know, the volatility at best describes the future distribution of
  prices for an underlying contract.
+ Historical Volatility
+ Forecast Volatility
+ Implied Volatility: It is volatility being implied to the
  underlying contract through the pricing of the option in the
  marketplace. Even though the term premium real1y refers to an
  option's price, it is common among traders to refer to the implied
  volati1ity as the premium or premium level. If the current implied
  volatility is high by historical standards, or high relative to the
  recent historical volatility of the underlying contract, a trader
  might say that premium levels are high; if implied volatility is
  unusuallylow,he might say that premium levels are low.  
  
  He might
  then look at the difference between each option's theoretical value
  and its price in marke lace selling any options which were
  overpriced relative to the theoretical value, and buying any options
  which were underpriced. 
+ Seasonal Volatility: 
* Using an Option's Theoretical Value
The purchase or sale of a theoretically mispriced option requires us
to  establish a hedge by taking an opposing positlon in the
underlying contract. When this is done correctly, for small changes
in the price of the underlying, the increase (decrease) in the value
of the optlon position will exactly offset the decrease  (increase) in
the value of the opposing position in the underlying contract. Such a
hedge is unbiased, or *neutral*, as to the direction of the underlying
contract.

The number which enables us to establish a neutral hedge under current
market  conditions is a by-product of theoretical pricing model and is
known as the *hedge ratio* or, more commonly, the *delta*. 

1. The delta of a call option is always somewhere between 0 and 1.00. 
2. The delta of an option can change as market conditions change. 
3. An underlying contract always has a delta of 1.00. 

The steps we have thus far taken illustrate the correct procedure in
using an option theoretical value:
1. Purchase (sell) undervalued (overvalued) options.
2. Establish a delta neutraI hedge against the underlying contract.
3. Adjust the hedge at regular intervals to remain delta neutral.

At that time we plan to close out the position by:
1. Letting any out-of-the-money options expire worthless.
2. Selling any in-the-money options at parity (intrinsic value) or,
   equiva1ently, exercising them and offsetting them against the
   underlying futures contract.
3. Liquidating any outstanding futures contracts at the market price.


1n a frictionless market we assume that: 
1.  Traders can freely buy or sell the underlying contract without
    restriction 
2.  AlI traders can borrow and lend money at the same rate. 
3.  Transaction costs are zero. 
4.  There are no tax considerations. 
* Option Values and Changing Market Conditions 
** THE DELTA
three interpretations of delta:
+ the hedge ratio
+ Rate of Change in the theoretical value: The de1ta is a measure of how an optio 's value
  changes with respect to a change in the price of the underlying
  contract.
+ Theoretical or Equivalent Underlying Position 
** THE GAMMA
The gamma sometimes referred to as the curvature of an option,
is the rate at which an option's delta changes as the price of the
underlying changes. 

If an option has a gamrna of 5for each point rise (fal1) in the price
of the und.erlying,the option will gain (lose) 5 de1tas.

Every option trader learns to look carefully not only at current
directional risk (the delta), but also at how that directional risk
will change if the underlying market begins ωmove (the gamma).
** THE THETA
The *theta(θ)* ，or tíme decay factor,is the rate at which an
option loses value as time passes.
** THE VEGA OR KAPPA
The *vega* of an option is usually given in point change ín theoretical
value for each one percentage point change in volatility.

Since vega is not a Greek letter, a common alternative in academic
literature, where Greek letters are preferred, is kappa (K).
** THE RHO
The sensitivity of an optio 's theoretical value to a change in
interest rates is given by its rho (P).
** SUMMARY
+ Delta: Deltas range from zero for far out-of.the-money calls to 100
  for deeply in-the-money calls, and from zero for far
  out-of-the-money puts to -100 for deeply in-the-money puts.

  At-the-money calls have deltas of approximately 50, and at-the-money
  puts approximately -50.

  As time passes,or as we decrease our volatility assumption,call
  deltas move away om 50,and puts deltas away from -50. As we increase
  our volatility assumption, cal1 deltas move towards 50, and put
  deltas towards -50.
+ Gamma: At-the-money options have greater gammas than either in- or
  out-of-the-money options with otherwise identical contract
  specifications.

  As we increase our volati1ity assumptíon, the gamma of an in~ or
  out-of~the~money option rises, while gamma of an at le~money option
  falls. As we decrease our volatility assumption, or as time to
  expiration grows shorter, the gamma of an in~ or out-of~the money
  option falls, while the gamma of an at~the-money option rises,
  sometimes dramatically.
+ Theta: At-the~money options have greater etas than either in~ or
  out~ofthe-money options with otherwise identical contract
  specifications.

  The theta of an at-the-money option increases as expiration
  approaches. A short-term, at-the-money option will a1 ways decay
  more quickly than a long-term, at-the-money option.
  
  As we increase (decrease) our volatility assumption, the theta of an
  option will rise (fall). Higher volatility means there is greater
  time value associated with the option, so at each day's decay wil1
  also be greater when no movement occurs.
+ Vega: At-the-money options have greater vegas than either in- or
  out-ofthe-money options With otherwise identical contract
  specifications.
  
  Out-of-the-money options have the greatest vega as apercent of
  theoretical value.

The various positions and their respective signs are given in Figure
6-26. The sign of the delta， gamma, theta, or vega, toge er with the
magnitude of the numbers, tel1 the trader which changes in market
conditions will either help or hurt his position, and to what degree.
The positive or negative effect of changing market conditions is
summarized in Figure 6-27.

An option's *elasticity*, sometimes denoted with the Greek letter
omega(or less commonly the Greek letter lambda), is the relative
percent change in an option's value for a given percent change in the
price of the underlying contract.

The elasticity is sometimes referred to as the option's *leverage
value*. The greater an option's elasticity, the more highly leverage
the option.

An easy method of calculating:

elasticity = (underlying price) / (theoretical value) * delta

* Introduction to Spreading
Spreading is simply a way of enabling an optlon trader to take
advantage of theoretlcally mispriced options, while at the same time
reducing the effects of short-term changes in market conditions so
that he can safely hold an optlon positlon to maturity.
