#+TITLE: Option Volatility & Pricing, Advanced Trading Strategies and Techniques

* The language of options
** Contract specifications
Two *types*:
1. Call option: the right to buy or take a long position in a given
   asset at a fixed price on or before a specified data.
2. Put option: the right to sell or take a short position in a given
   asset.

The *difference* between an option and a futures contract:
1. A futures contract requires delivery at a fixed price. The seller
   must make delivery and the buyer must take delivery of the asset.
2. The buyer of an option can choose to take delivery(a call) or make
   delivery(a put).


The *exercise price*, or *strike price* is the price at which the
underlying will be delivered should the holder of an option choose to
exercise his right to buy or sell.

*expiration date*: The date after which the option may no longer be
exercised is the expiration date.

The premium paid for an option can be separated into two components,
the *intrinsic value* and the *time value*.

The additional amount ofpremium beyond the intrinsic value which
traders are willing to pay for an option is the time value, sometimes
also referred to as the option's time premium or extrinsic value.  

An option's premium is always composed of precisely its intrinsic
value and its time value. If a $400 gold call is trading at $50 with gold
at $435 per ounce, the time value of the call must be $15 , since the
intrinsic value is $35. The two components must add up to the option's
total premium of $50. 

If the option has no time value,its price will consist solely of
intrinsic value. The option is trading at *parity*.

Any option which has a positive intrinsic value is said to be
*in-the-money* by the amount of the intrinsic value. An option which
has no intrinsic value is said to be *out-of-the-money*.

An option whose exercise price is identical to the current price of
the underlying contract is said to be *at-the-money*, such an option
is also out-of-the-money since it has no intrinsic value.

The distinction between an at-the-money and out-of-the-money option 
because an at-the-money option has the greatest amount of time premium
and is usually traded very actively.

** MARGIN REQUIREMENTS
When a trader makes an opening trade on an exchange, the exchange may
require the trader to deposit some amount of *margin*, or good faith
capital.

** COMBINATION STRATEGIES
+ the profit and loss at expiration from the combined purchase of a
  100 call for 2.70, and a 100 put for 3.70

+ buy a 105 put for 7.10 and sell a 100 put for 3.70, for a total
  debit of 3.40

** CONSTRUCT AN EXPlRATION GRAPH
1. If the graph bends, it wìll do so at an exercise price. Therefore,
   we can calculate the proflt or 10ss at each exercise price involved
   and simply connect these points with straight lines.
2. If the position is 10ng and short equa1 numbers of cal1s (puts),
   the potential downside (upside) risk or reward wi11be equal ωthe
   total debit or credit required to establish the position.
3. Ab ove highest exercise price all calls will go into-the-money, so
   the entire position will act like an underlying position which is
   either long or short underlying contracts equal to the number of
   net long or short calls. Below the lowest exercise price all puts
   will go into-the-money, so the entire position will act like an
   underlying position which is either long or short underlying
   contracts equal to the number of net long or short puts.
*** example 1
+ long one 95 call at 5.50
+ short three 105 calls at 1.15

+ long two 100 calls at 2.70
+ short four 95 puts at 1.55
+ long two 100 puts at 3.70

*** example 4

* Introduction to Theoretical Pricing Models
If he purchases options, not only must he be right about market
direction, he must also be right about *market speed*. 

The minimum factors you must consider:
1. The price of the underlying contract.
2. The exercise price.
3. The amount of time remaining to expiration.
4. The direction in which he expects the underlying market move.
5. The speed at which he expects the underlying market to move.

** THEORETICAL VALUE 
The two most common considerations in a financial investment are the
expected return and carrying costs. And, in fact, dividends are an
additional consideration in evaluating options on stock.

The goal of option evaluation is to determine, through the use of
theoretical pricing models, the theoretical value of an option. The
trader can then make an intelligent decision whether the option is
overpriced or underpriced in the marketplace, and whether the
theoretical edage is sufficient to justify going into the marketplace
and making a trade.
