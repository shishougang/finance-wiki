#+TITLE: IB Application Programming Interfaces


* Overview
IB offers several alternatives for connecting directly to our trading
system, including:

1. A proprietary Application Program Interface (API) which operates
   through the Trader Workstation and does not require additional
   technical overhead such as a dedicated FIX server.

2. An industry standard FIX solution for customers who can support a
   FIX Computer-to-Computer Interface (CTCI) infrastructure.

Our CTCI connection supports FIX versions 4.1 and 4.2, with support
for selected 4.3, 4.4 and custom IB tags

* FIX CTCI[fn:1]
** FIX CTCI Connection Types
+ Internet	Standard connection through public internet. Requires
  IB Gateway connection interface.

+ Extranet	A T1 line routed to one of IB's extranet providers,
  Radianz TNS or Savvis. They route directly to IB over a secure
  private line.

+ VPN	IB supports a dedicated Virtual Private Network (VPN) tunnel
  from the client's data center directly to one of IB's Data Centers.
  A VPN provides a secure method of connecting over the public
  Internet without the need to maintain a dedicated leased line or
  extranet connection.

+ Dedicated Line	Client pays for a T1 line that connects
  directly to one of IB's Data Centers, which are located throughout
  the world. A dedicated lease line connects users directly into the
  IB system and facilitates a quicker and more secure connection than
  a regular Internet line.

+ Cross-Connect	Equinix NY4 colocation facility (tier 4 datacenter) is
  located in Secaucus, New Jersey. IB has a client point of presence
  at this datacenter. Clients who are also located in this datacenter
  can order a cross-connect from the datacenter to IB's client facing
  servers there. The client is responsible for the costs of the
  cross-connect. Once the cross-connect is ordered by the client (with
  NY4), IB's network engineers will work with the client and the
  datacenter.
